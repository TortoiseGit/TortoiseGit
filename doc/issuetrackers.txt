Integration of Git (GUI) clients with Bug Tracking Tools:
================================================================================

I. Preface
==========
This document is primarily intended for writers of various GUI clients for 
Git.  Clients such as TortoiseGit, TortoiseSVN, Subclipse, RapidSVN, PySVN and many 
others.

The goal of this document is to outline a common technique for defining and then 
integrating these GUI clients with third party bug tracking software.  

II. Introduction
================
It is very common in Software Development for changes to be related to a 
specific bug or issue ID. Users of bug tracking systems would like to associate 
the changes they make in Git with a specific ID in their bug tracking 
system. There are already a number of people that have integrated these systems 
with Git. They typically rely on the end user entering a log message on 
their commits in some kind of a specific format that can be parsed with a 
commit-hook or in some cases just on-the-fly in a web-based presentation of the 
commit info. This option is OK, but it is not very user-friendly and it places 
all of the integration within the bug tracking tool. When using a Git 
client, you can see the log message info, but there is no way to jump to the bug 
system.

Git (GUI) clients can help both the users and the bug tracking tools in 
that task:

- When the user enters a log message, a well defined line including the issue 
number associated with the commit can be added by the client automatically. This 
reduces the risk that the users enters the issue number in a way the bug 
tracking tools can't parse correctly and therefore won't know that the commit 
was associated with a specific issue. The users won't have to remember the 
format they have to use for each log message and each individual project - the 
client will take care of that.

- When the user browses the log messages, there should be an easy way to fire up 
the webbrowser to see the issue associated with that log message/commit.

III. Requirements
=================
To make the integration with bug tracking tools possible, a Git client 
needs some information about the bug tracking tool used in a project. That 
information should be available inside the working copy so that clients don't 
have to access the repository over a possibly very slow connection to get that 
information.

The information a client needs is:

- the URL pointing to the bug tracking tool 
- the format of the issue number it has to add to the log messages so the 
  bug tracking tool can recognize it. Or
- a regular expression to parse the log message with to extract the issue number

There are other things a Git (GUI) client could use to make the 
integration with bug tracking tools easier for the user, but these are 
essential for the integration to work.

IV. Implementation
==================
The required information is stored in the .git/config file.

There are two different ways a client can integrate with an issue tracker. One
is very basic but provides the user with a separate GUI to enter bug ID's,
and the other one is based on regular expressions where the user has to enter
the bug ID's directly into the log message.


The following properties are defined which are used by both ways:

---------
name  : bugtraq.url
value : (string)
This value is the URL pointing to the bug tracking tool. The URL string should 
contain the substring "%BUGID%" which the client replaces with the issue number. 
That way the resulting URL will point directly to the correct issue.
NOTE: The URL must be properly URI encoded by the user.
This URL can be used by clients to create a link to the bug tracking tool when
showing the logmessage of a revision.
---------

---------
name  : bugtraq.warnifnoissue
value : "true"/"yes" or "false"/"no"
If set to "true", then the clients will warn the user if the issue text box is
left empty. But it must _not_ block the commit, only give the user a chance to
enter an issue number in case (s)he forgot it.
---------

Properties used with the basic integration:

---------
name  : bugtraq.label
value : (string)
This can be used by a client as a GUI label describing the text box where the 
user has to enter the issue number. If this is not set, then a default value 
should be used, e.g. "Bug-ID / Issue-Number :". Keep in mind though that most 
GUI clients don't resize their windows according to the size of GUI elements. So 
keep the size of the label string below 20-25 chars.
---------

---------
name  : bugtraq.message
value : (string)
If this property is set, then the client should show a text box in the commit 
window where the user can enter an issue number.

The value string of this property is used by the client to create an additional 
line added to the log message. The string must contain the substring "%BUGID%" 
which is replaced with the issue number the user entered before applied to the 
log message. The client will add the resulting string as a new line to the end 
of the log message the user entered:
logmessage + "\n" + resultstring
In case bugtraq.append is set to "false", then the log message is defined as
resultstring + "\n" + logmessage

The client should make sure that the string doesn't have multiple lines.
If more than one issue number is entered by the user (separated by commas), the 
client must make sure that there's no whitespace chars before and after the 
comma. And also the whole issue number string must be trimmed.
Note: if the bugtraq.logregex property is set, then this property should be
ignored for parsing the log message but only be used to show the issue ID edit box.
---------

---------
name  : bugtraq.number
value : "true"/"yes" or "false"/"no"
If this property is set to "false", then the client allows any character entered 
in the issue text box. Any other value or if the property is missing then only 
numbers are allowed as the issue number. One exception is the ',' char, which is
used to separate multiple issues.

The client must never complain if the text box is left empty, i.e. if no issue
number is given. Not all commits are assigned to an issue!

Note: if the property bugtraq.logregex is set and this property is set to false,
then the client should use the regex against the created string which is added
to the log message to check if the bug ID is valid.
---------

---------
name  : bugtraq.append
value : "true"/"yes" or "false"/"no"
If set to "false", then the bugtraq.message part is inserted at the top of
the log message, if "yes" or not set, then it's appended to the log message at
the bottom.
---------


Properties used with the regex integration:

---------
name  : bugtraq.logregex
value : (string)
This property contains one or two regular expressions, separated by a newline.
If only one expression is set, then the bare bug ID's must be matched in the
groups of the regex string. Example:
[Ii]ssue #?(\d+)

If two expressions are set, then the first expression is used to find a 
string which relates to a bug ID but may contain more than just the bug ID 
(e.g. "Issue #123" or "resolves issue 123").
The second expression is then used to extract the bare bug ID from the string
extracted with the first expression.
An example:
if you want to catch every pattern "issue #XXX" and "issue #890, #789" inside
a log message you could use the following regex strings:
[Ii]ssue #?(\d+)(,? ?#?(\d+))+
(\d+)

The property bugtraq.logregex will override bugtraq.number and bugtraq.message.
If both bugtraq.logregex and bugtraq.message are set, then bugtraq.message is
only used if the user enters an issue ID in the edit box of the commit window.
Both are used in the log window to find the URL's to point to the issuetracker.
---------


Please note:
- All property names and values must be properly UTF8 encoded. The client must
  take care of that when setting the properties.
