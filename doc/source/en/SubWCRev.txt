SubWCRev  -  A Working Copy Status Tool for Subversion
------------------------------------------------------

SubWCRev is Windows console program which can be used to read the status
of a Subversion working copy and optionally perform keyword substitution
in a template file.

usage: SubWCRev WorkingCopyPath [SrcVersionFile DstVersionFile] [-nmdfe]

Params:
WorkingCopyPath    :   path to a Subversion working copy.
SrcVersionFile     :   path to a template header file containing keywords.
DstVersionFile     :   path to save the resulting parsed file.
-n                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will error if the working
                       copy contains local modifications.
-m                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will error if the working
                       copy contains mixed revisions.
-d                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will only do its job if
                       DstVersionFile does not exist.
-f                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will include the
                       last-changed revision of folders. Default is to
                       use only files to get the revision numbers.
                       This only affects $WCREV$ and $WCDATE$
-e                 :   if given, also include dirs which are included
                       with svn:externals, but only if they are from the
                       same repository.

Switches must be given in a single argument, eg. '-nm' not '-n -m'.

SubWCRev reads the Subversion status of all files in a working copy, excluding
externals. It records the highest commit revision number found, and the commit
timestamp of that revision, and also whether there are local modifications in
the working copy, or mixed update revisions. The revision number, update
revision range and modification status are displayed on stdout.

If a source and destination files are supplied, SubWCRev copies source
to destination, performing keyword substitution as follows:

$WCREV$ is replaced with the highest commit revision in the working copy.

$WCDATE$ is replaced with the commit date/time of that revision in
international format, ie. yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss

$WCNOW$ is replaced with the current date/time in international format.

$WCRANGE$ is replaced with the update revision range in the working copy.
If the working copy is in a consistent state, this will be a single revision.
If the working copy contains mixed revisions, either due to being out of date,
or due to a deliberate update-to-revision, then the range will be shown
in the form 100:200

$WCMIXED?TrueText:FalseText$ is replaced with TrueText if there are
mixed update revisions, or FalseText if not.

$WCMODS?TrueText:FalseText$ is replaced with TrueText if there are
local modifications, or FalseText if not.

$WCURL$ is replaced with the repository URL of the working copy path
passed to SubWCRev.

Finally, an optional switch may be added to abort SubWCRev if certain
conditions are not met.

The -n switch causes SubWCRev to abort with ERRORLEVEL 7 if there are
any local modifications.

The -m switch causes SubWCRev to abort with ERRORLEVEL 8 if there are
mixed update revisions.

The -d switch causes SubWCRev to abort with ERRORLEVEL 9 if the destination
file already exists.
