			Because TortoiseSVN is being developed all the time
			it is sometimes hard to keep the documentation completely
			up to date. We maintain an  
			<ulink url="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/faq.html">
				<citetitle>online FAQ</citetitle>
			</ulink>
			which contains a selection of the questions we are asked
			the most on the TortoiseSVN mailing lists
			<email>dev@tortoisesvn.tigris.org</email> and
			<email>users@tortoisesvn.tigris.org</email>.
		</para>
		<para>
			We also maintain a project
			<ulink url="http://issues.tortoisesvn.net">
				<citetitle>Issue Tracker</citetitle>
			</ulink>
			which tells you about some of the things we have on our To-Do list,
			and bugs which have already been fixed. If you think you have found
			a bug, or want to request a new feature, check here first to see
			if someone else got there before you.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you have a question which is not answered anywhere
			else, the best place to ask it is on one of the mailing lists.
			<email>users@tortoisesvn.tigris.org</email> is the one to use
			if you have questions about using TortoiseSVN.
			If you want to help out with the development of TortoiseSVN,
			then you should take part in discussions on
			<email>dev@tortoisesvn.tigris.org</email>.
