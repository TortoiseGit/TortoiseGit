		One of the features of version control systems is the ability
		to isolate changes onto a separate line of development.
		This line is known as a <firstterm>branch</firstterm>.
		Branches are often used to try out new features without
		disturbing the main line of development with compiler
		errors and bugs. As soon as the new feature is stable enough
		then the development branch is <firstterm>merged</firstterm>
		back into the main branch (trunk).
	</para>
	<para>
		Another feature of version control systems is the ability
		to mark particular revisions (e.g. a release version),
		so you can at any time recreate a certain build or
		environment. This process is known as <firstterm>tagging</firstterm>.
	</para>
	<para>
		Subversion does not have special commands for branching
		or tagging, but uses so-called <quote>cheap copies</quote>
		instead. Cheap copies are similar to hard links in Unix, which means
		that instead of making a complete copy in the repository, an internal
		link is created, pointing to a specific tree/revision. As a result
		branches and tags are very quick to create, and take up almost
		no extra space in the repository.

		<title>Creating a Branch or Tag</title>
		<para>
			If you have imported your project with the recommended
			directory structure, creating a branch or tag version is very simple:
			<figure id="tsvn-dug-branchtag-dia-1">
				<title>The Branch/Tag Dialog</title>
				<graphic fileref="../images/Copy.png"/>
			</figure>
			Select the folder in your working copy which you want to copy
			to a branch or tag, then select the command
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Branch/Tag...</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>.
		</para>
		<para>
			The default destination URL for the new branch
			will be the source URL on which your working copy is based.
			You will need to edit that URL to the new path for your branch/tag.
			So instead of
<screen>
    http://svn.collab.net/repos/ProjectName/trunk
</screen>
			you might now use something like
<screen>
    http://svn.collab.net/repos/ProjectName/tags/Release_1.10
</screen>
			If you can't remember the naming convention you used last time,
			click the button on the right to open the repository browser
			so you can view the existing repository structure.
		</para>
		<para>
			Now you have to select the source of the copy. Here you have
			three options:
			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>HEAD revision in the repository</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
						The new branch is copied directly in the repository
						from the HEAD revision. No data needs to be transferred
						from your working copy, and the branch is created
						very quickly.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Specific revision in the repository</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
						The new branch is copied directly in the repository
						but you can choose an older revision. This is useful
						if you forgot to make a tag when you released your
						project last week. If you can't remember the revision
						number, click the button on the right to show the
						revision log, and select the revision number from
						there. Again no data is transferred from your working
						copy, and the branch is created very quickly.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Working copy</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
						The new branch is an identical copy of your local
						working copy. If you have updated some files to an
						older revision in your WC, or if you have made local
						changes, that is exactly what goes into the copy.
						Naturally this sort of complex tag may involve
						transferring data from your WC back to the repository
						if it does not exist there already.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
			</variablelist>
		</para>
		<para>
			If you want your working copy to be switched to the newly created
			branch automatically, use the
			<guilabel>Switch working copy to new branch/tag</guilabel> checkbox.
			But if you do that, first make sure that your working copy does not
			contain modifications. If it does, those changes will be merged into
			the branch WC when you switch.
		</para>
		<para>
			Press <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to commit the new copy to the
			repository. Don't forget to supply a log message. Note that the
			copy is created <emphasis>inside the repository</emphasis>.
		</para>
		<para>
			Note that unless you opted to switch your working copy to the newly
			created branch, creating a Branch or Tag does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
			affect your working copy. Even if you create the branch from your WC,
			those changes are committed to the new branch, not to the trunk, so your
			WC may still be marked as modified with respect to the trunk.

		<?dbhh topicname="HIDD_SWITCH"?>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>switch</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
			...that is (not really) the question. While a checkout downloads
			everything from the desired branch in the repository to your working
			directory,
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Switch...</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>
			only transfers the changed data to your
			working copy. Good for the network load, good for your patience. :-)
		</para>
		<para>
			To be able to work with your freshly generated branch or tag you
			have several ways to handle it. You can:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<menuchoice>
							<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
							<guimenuitem>Checkout</guimenuitem>
						</menuchoice>
						to make a fresh checkout in an empty folder.
						You can check out to any location on your
						local disk and you can create as many working copies
						from your repository as you like.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Switch your current working copy to the
						newly created copy in the repository. Again select the
						top level folder of your project and use
						<menuchoice>
							<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
							<guimenuitem>Switch...</guimenuitem>
						</menuchoice>
						from the context menu.
					</para>
					<para>
						In the next dialog enter the URL of the branch you just created.
						Select the
						<guilabel>Head Revision</guilabel>
						radio button and click on
						<guibutton>OK</guibutton>.
						Your working copy is switched to the new branch/tag.
					</para>
					<para>
						Switch works just like Update in that it never discards your
						local changes. Any changes you have made to your working copy
						which have not yet been committed will be merged when you
						do the Switch. If you do not want this to happen then you
						must either commit the changes before switching, or revert
						your working copy to an already-committed revision (typically HEAD).
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						If you want to work on trunk and branch, but don't want
						the expense of a fresh checkout, you can use Windows Explorer
						to make a copy of your trunk checkout in another folder, then
						<menuchoice>
							<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
							<guimenuitem>Switch...</guimenuitem>
						</menuchoice>
						that copy to your new branch.
					</para>

			Although Subversion itself makes no distinction between tags
			and branches, the way they are typically used differs a bit.
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Tags are typically used to create a static snapshot of the
						project at a particular stage. As such they not normally
						used for development - that's what branches are for, which
						is the reason we recommended the
						<filename>/trunk /branches /tags</filename>
						repository structure in the first place. Working on a tag
						revision is <emphasis>not a good idea</emphasis>, but
						because your local files are not write protected there is
						nothing to stop you doing this by mistake.
						However, if you try to commit to a path in the repository
						which contains <filename>/tags/</filename>, TortoiseSVN will
						warn you.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						It may be that you need to make further changes to a
						release which you have already tagged. The correct way
						to handle this is to create a new branch from the tag
						first and commit the branch. Do your Changes on this
						branch and then create a new tag from this new branch, e.g. 
						<filename>Version_1.0.1</filename>.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						If you modify a working copy created from
						a branch and commit, then all changes go to the new
						branch and <emphasis>not</emphasis> the trunk.
						Only the modifications are stored.
						The rest remains a cheap copy.
					</para>
