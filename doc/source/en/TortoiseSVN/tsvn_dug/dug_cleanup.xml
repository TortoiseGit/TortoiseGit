		If a Subversion command cannot complete successfully, perhaps
		due to server problems, your working copy can be left in an
		inconsistent state. In that case you need to use
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Cleanup</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		on the folder. It is a good idea to do this at the top level
		of the working copy.
	</para>

		Cleanup has another useful side effect. If a file date changes
		but its content doesn't, Subversion cannot tell whether it has
		really changed except by doing a byte-by-byte comparison with
		the pristine copy. If you have a lot of files in this state it
		makes acquiring status very slow, which will make many dialogs
		slow to respond. Executing a Cleanup on your working copy will
		repair these <quote>broken</quote> timestamps and restore
		status checks to full speed.
	</para>
	<tip>
		<title>Use Commit Timestamps</title>
		<para>
			Some earlier releases of Subversion were affected by a bug
			which caused timestamp mismatch when you check out with
			the <guilabel>Use commit timestamps</guilabel> option
			checked. Use the Cleanup command to speed up these
			working copies.
