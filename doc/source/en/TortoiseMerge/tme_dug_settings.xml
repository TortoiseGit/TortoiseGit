		<para>
			Most of the options here are self-explanatory, but a few
			points need clarifying.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Backup original file</guilabel>
			renames the original file in the WC to <literal>filename.bak</literal>
			before saving the modified version.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Ignore line endings</guilabel>
			hides changes which are due solely to difference in line-end style.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Ignore case changes</guilabel>
			hides changes which are due solely to case changes within the text.
			This can be useful with apps such as Visual Basic, which changes
			case in variables without warning.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Colour code in-line changes</guilabel>
			uses the same scheme as the line diff bar to show the detailed
			in-line changes within the main display panes.
			Lines which have been heavily modified will not be shown using this
			method as the results are simply confusing. In this case the line
			will be shown as replaced (old line deleted, new line added).
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Compare whitespaces</guilabel>
			shows all changes in indentation and inline whitespace as
			added/removed lines (which is how Subversion treats such changes).
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Ignore whitespace changes</guilabel>
			hides changes which are due solely to a change in the
			amount or type of whitespace, eg. changing the indentation
			or changing tabs to spaces. Adding whitespace where there
			was none before, or removing a whitespace completely is still
			shown as a change.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Ignore all whitespaces</guilabel>
			hides all whitespace-only changes.
