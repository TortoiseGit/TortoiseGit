		When you start TortoiseGitMerge without any command line switches then

		The first thing you have to do is to decide whether you just want
		to compare/merge files, or whether you want to apply a patch file.
		Depending on what you choose, the corresponding edit boxes and
		browse buttons are activated.

		<title>Viewing / Merging</title>
		<para>
			If you want to compare / merge files you have to set at least two 
			of the three possible paths for <literal>Base</literal>,
			<literal>Mine</literal> and <literal>Theirs</literal>. 
			If you select only two files, then TortoiseGitMerge will show 
			you the differences between those two files, either in a two 
			pane view or in a one pane view.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you want to merge three files, TortoiseGitMerge 
			will show you the differences in a three pane view. This view 
			is generally used if you need to resolve conflicted files.
			The output file is not named in this case and you will have to
			use the
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>File</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Save As...</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>.
			to save the results.

		<title>Applying Patches</title>
		<para>
			If you want to apply a patch file you have to set both the path
			to the patch file itself and the path to the folder where the
			patch file should be applied.

		<caution>
			<para>
				Currently, only patch files in
				<emphasis>Unified Diff Format</emphasis> are supported.
				And only files which were generated from a Git
				working copy. Other formats like patch files generated by
				CVS are currently not supported!
