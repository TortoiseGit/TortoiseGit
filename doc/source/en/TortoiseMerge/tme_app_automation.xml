	<title>Automating TortoiseGitMerge</title>
	<simplesect>
		<para>
			TortoiseGitMerge can be started with command line parameters to avoid having
			to go through the <guilabel>Open</guilabel> dialog to select the files
			yourself. This is useful also if you want to use TortoiseGitMerge from
			another application.

			Most switches require additional information like a path or some
			other string. In those cases, append an ':' to the switch and put
			the string/path after it. Example:
<screen>
/base:"c:\folder\my base file.txt"
</screen>

Don't touch these lines:
<entry condition="pot">/about</entry>

  The condition="pot" prevents the strings from being extracted into
  the .pot file, so nobody translates them.
  The '/' in front of the command has to stay there to prevent these strings
  from being translated if the po file "by chance" contains a matching translation.

			You can also supply simple filenames on the command line for compatibility
			with other diff programs. In this simplified form the command line is
<screen>
TortoiseGitMerge BaseFilePath MyFilePath [ TheirFilePath ]
</screen>
			If two files are given they will be compared with each other.
			If three files are given, the first is taken as the BASE file,
			and the other two are compared with it in a three-way diff.
