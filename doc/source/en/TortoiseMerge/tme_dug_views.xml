	<title>Viewing Modes</title>
	<para>
		TortoiseMerge has three main viewing modes: one-pane, two-pane
		and three-pane view. One/two-pane view is used to view changes
		and three-pane view is used to resolve conflicts.
	</para>

		<para>
			The two pane view has some features which are not available
			in the one pane view:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Changes inside the modified lines are shown in different
						colors. Added string parts are shown with a lighter color,
						but you can of course configure the colors used here.
						Removed parts are indicated with a dark brown vertical
						line in the string. Check out the screenshot above to
						see how this works.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Code reorganization usually means a lot of changes in whitespaces
						(space, tab, newlines) but no actual code change. For example,
						you split up a very long line into several lines, or you sometimes
						compact several lines together into one.
					</para>
					<para>
						Such changes are marked with a white circle symbol on the left side
						of the views. If you see such a white circle, you know immediately
						that no real code change is there and you don't have to check the
						changed block further.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Hand editing of the file in the right pane is possible in two-pane
						view. Such changes are marked with a pencil symbol.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>
		<para>
			If you want to compare/merge three files, TortoiseMerge 
			will show you the differences in a three pane view. This view 
			is also used if you need to resolve conflicted files.
		</para>
		<figure id="tmerge-dug-dia-3pane">
			<title>Three Pane View</title>
			<graphic fileref="images/TMerge_ThreePane.png"/>
		</figure>
		<para>
			The left pane shows you the differences between 
			<emphasis>Their</emphasis> file and the <emphasis>Base</emphasis>
			file, while the right pane shows you the differences between
			<emphasis>Mine</emphasis> file and the <emphasis>Base</emphasis>
			file. The bottom pane shows you the result of merging
			<emphasis>Base</emphasis>, <emphasis>Mine</emphasis> and 
			<emphasis>Theirs</emphasis> with possible conflicts.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you hover the mouse over the pane title, a tooltip will
			show the filenames used for the diff in each pane.
		</para>

	<sect2 id="tmerge-dug-view-patch">
		<title>Applying Patches</title>
		<para>
			After TortoiseMerge parses the patch file it will show
			you a small window with all the files which have changes
			according to the patch file.
			<figure id="tmerge-dug-dia-patch">
				<title>Patch File List</title>
				<graphic fileref="images/TMerge_PatchWindow.png"/>
			</figure>
			If the filename is shown in black, then the patch can be applied
			without any problems. That means the file is not outdated
			according to the patch.
			However, if the filename is shown in red, then the patch can't
			get applied directly because you already changed that file.
		</para>
		<para>
			But don't worry. If you're working with Subversion you can
			retrieve an older version of the file and resolve the conflict.
			In fact, TortoiseMerge automatically tries to get that older
			version of the file and then shows you the diff between
			<emphasis>Base</emphasis> (the older version of the file),
			<emphasis>Mine</emphasis> (the file as it is currently in your
			working copy) and <emphasis>Theirs</emphasis> (the older version
			of the file with the patch already applied). Then you can
			resolve possible conflicts manually.
		</para>
		<para>
			The patch file window has a context menu which allows you to
			preview the effect of the patch on the current file
			(apply without saving), to apply and save the changes
			for the selected file, or to apply and save changes to
			<emphasis>all</emphasis> files in the list.
			The double-click action is to preview.
		</para>
		<para>
			Depending on whether TortoiseMerge can apply the patch directly
			or by fetching an older version of the file first, it shows you
			a two pane view (patch can be applied directly) or a three pane
			view (older version of file fetched).
