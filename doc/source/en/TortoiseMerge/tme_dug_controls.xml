    <title>Buttons and Other Controls</title>
    <para>
        Depending on your setting, you either see a toolbar or a ribbon
        with many buttons. The buttons all show a tooltip explaining their
        function when you hover the mouse pointer over them.

        On the left side of the window is a locator bar. This provides
        a quick visual reference as to where the changes lie within the
        file. The bar has three columns. The left column refers to the
        left pane, the right column to the right pane, and the centre
        column to the bottom pane (if present). In one-pane view only
        the left column is used. The locator bar can also be used as a
        scroll bar to scroll all the windows simultaneously.
    </para>
    <para>
        If you double click on a word then every occurrence of that word will
        be highlighted throughout the document, both in the main panes and the
        locator bar. Double click on the word again to remove the highlighting.
    </para>
    <para>
        If you click in the left margin, or if you triple click within a line,
        that whole line will be selected.
    </para>
    <para>
        Below the bottom window is the status bar. This shows the number of
        lines added and deleted in <literal>Theirs</literal> and
        <literal>Mine</literal>, and the number of unresolved
        conflicts remaining.
        You can also see which line-ending style is in use, what
        encoding (ASCII, UTF-8, etc) is assumed by TortoiseGitMerge, and whether
        there is a byte-order-mark (BOM) present in UTF-8 files.
        The left side of the status bar is used to display hints when you
        hover the mouse over a control.
