		If you want to undo all changes you made in a file since
		the last update you need to select the file,
		<action>right click</action> to pop up the context menu and then select
		the command
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Revert</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		A dialog will pop up showing you the files that you've changed and
		can revert. Select those you want to revert and click on

		If you want to undo a deletion or a rename, you need to use
		Revert on the parent folder as the deleted item does not
		exist for you to right-click on.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you want to undo the addition of an item, this appears in
		the context menu as
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Delete (keep local)</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.
		This is really a revert as well, but the name has been changed
		to make it more obvious.

		<title>Revert is Slow</title>
		<para>
			When you revert changes you may find that the operation takes a lot
			longer than you expect. This is because the modified version of the
			file is sent to the recycle bin, so you can retrieve your changes
			if you reverted by mistake. However, if your recycle bin is full,
			Windows takes a long time to find a place to put the file. The
			solution is simple: either empty the recycle bin or deactivate
			the <guilabel>Use recycle bin when reverting</guilabel> box
			in TortoiseGit's settings.
