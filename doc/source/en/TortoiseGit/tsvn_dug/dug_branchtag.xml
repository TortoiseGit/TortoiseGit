		One of the features of version control systems is the ability
		to isolate changes onto a separate line of development.
		This line is known as a <firstterm>branch</firstterm>.
		Branches are often used to try out new features without
		disturbing the main line of development with compiler
		errors and bugs. As soon as the new feature is stable enough
		then the development branch is <firstterm>merged</firstterm>
		back into the main branch.
	</para>
	<para>
		Another feature of version control systems is the ability
		to mark particular revisions (e.g. a release version),
		so you can at any time recreate a certain build or
		environment. This process is known as <firstterm>tagging</firstterm>.

		Git is very powerfull at branch and tag. It is very easy to create branch
		and tag.

		<para>
			Creating a branch is very simple:
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Create Branch...</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>
			<figure id="tsvn-dug-branchtag-dia-1">
				<title>The Branch Dialog</title>
				<graphic fileref="../images/Branch.png"/>
			</figure>
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Branch:</guilabel> input your branch name. 
		</para>
		<para>
			Creating a tag is very simple:
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Create Tag...</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>

		<para>
			<guilabel>Tag:</guilabel> input your tag name.

			You can choose one commit that base on. 
			<xi:include href="./dug_chooseversion.xml"/>

		<para>
			If you want your working tree to be switched to the newly created
			branch automatically, use the
			<guilabel>Switch to new branch/tag</guilabel> checkbox.
			But if you do that, first make sure that your working tree does not
			contain modifications. If it does, those changes will be merged into
			the branch working tree when you switch.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>track</guilabel> is a checkbox with three values. If it is checked
			<literal>--track</literal> is passed to git on <guilabel>OK</guilabel>, if it is
			unchecked <literal>--no-track</literal> is passed to git on <guilabel>OK</guilabel>.
			The third state indicates, that neither <literal>--track</literal> nor <literal>--no-track</literal>
			is passed to git on <guilabel>OK</guilabel> - see branch.autosetupmerge configuration variable
			(<xref linkend="git-config(1)"/>) and --track parameter documentation for <xref linkend="git-branch(1)"/>.
		</para>
		<para>
			Check <guilabel>Sign</guilabel> to create a signed tag. This requires GPG
			and a key <emphasis>without</emphasis> a passphrase.
		</para>
		<para>
			Press <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to create branch or tag at  
			<emphasis>local repository</emphasis>.
		</para>
		<para>
			Note that unless you opted to switch your working tree to the newly
			created branch, creating a Branch or Tag does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
			affect your working tree. Even if you create the branch from your working tree,
			those changes are committed to the original branch, not to the new branch.
