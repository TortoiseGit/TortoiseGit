    <para>
        A few infrequently used settings are available only in the advanced
        page of the settings dialog. These settings modify the registry directly
        and you have to know what each of these settings is used for and what
        it does. Do not modify these settings unless you are sure you need to
        change them.

                    The auto-completion list shown in the commit message editor
                    displays the names of files listed for commit.
                    To also include these names with extensions removed,
                    set this value to <literal>true</literal>.

                    If you don't want the explorer to update the status overlays

                    (e.g. Update, Commit, ...) then set this value to

                    This is really only useful for developers as it allows
                    you to terminate the program gracefully.

                    The extra columns the TortoiseGit adds to the details view
                    in Windows Explorer are normally only active in a working
                    copy. If you want those to be accessible everywhere, not
                    just in working trees, set this value to
                    <literal>true</literal>.
                    Note that the extra columns are only available in XP.
                    Vista and later doesn't support that feature any more.

                    TortoiseGit allows you to assign an external diff viewer.
                    Most such viewers, however, are not suited for change blaming
                    (<xref linkend="tsvn-dug-blame-diffs"/>),
                    so you might wish to fall back to TortoiseMerge in this case.
                    To do so, set this value to <literal>true</literal>.

            <term condition="pot">FullRowSelect</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    The status list control which is used in various dialogs
                    (e.g., commit, check-for-modifications, add, revert, ...)
                    uses full row selection (i.e., if you select an entry, the
                    full row is selected, not just the first column).
                    This is fine, but the selected row then also covers the
                    background image on the bottom right, which can look ugly.
                    To disable full row select, set this value to
                    <literal>false</literal>.

                <para>
                    This option toggles the re-adding of unselected added files after a commit. Up to
                    TortoiseGit 1.7.10 added files which were not checked on a commit, were removed from
                    the index and unversioned after the commit. Set this value to <literal>false</literal>
                    to restore the old behavior.
                    Set this value to <literal>true</literal> to readd these files again after the commit (default).

                    This option enables the use of Direct2D accelerated
                    drawing in the Scintilla control which is used
                    as the edit box in e.g. the commit dialog (also for the attached patch window), the
                    unified diff viewer and TortoiseGitBlame.
                    With some graphic cards, however, this sometimes
                    doesn't work properly so that the cursor to enter
                    text isn't always visible, the redraw does not work
                    or the background is flashing. It's disabled by default. You
                    can turn this feature on by setting this value
                    to <literal>true</literal>.

                    This can be useful if you use something other than the windows explorer

                    Set this value to <literal>false</literal>
                    if you don't want TortoiseGit to show icons for the
                    shell context menu items.
                    Set this value to <literal>true</literal> to show the icons again.

                    If you do not want to have a small background image in list controls (e.g. Commit Dialog)
                    set this value to <literal>false</literal>.
                    Set this value to <literal>true</literal> to show the images again (default).

                    This makes TGitCache check file contents if timestamps (to index) missmatch in order to
                    calculate the file status.
                    TortoiseGit 1.7.0 up to 1.7.12 calculated the file status based on the timestamp only.
                    If do not you want TGitCache to check the file contents (this lowers disk access and CPU time), set this value to <literal>false</literal>.

                    adding files to the index).
                    If you do not want TortoiseGit to use libgit2 for file operations, set this value to <literal>false</literal>.
