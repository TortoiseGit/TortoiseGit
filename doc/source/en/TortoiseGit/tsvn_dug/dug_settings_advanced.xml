    <para>
        A few infrequently used settings are available only in the advanced
        page of the settings dialog. These settings modify the registry directly
        and you have to know what each of these settings is used for and what
        it does. Do not modify these settings unless you are sure you need to
        change them.

                    The extra columns the TortoiseGit adds to the details view

                    TortoiseGit allows you to assign an external diff viewer.
                    Most such viewers, however, are not suited for change blaming
                    (<xref linkend="tsvn-dug-blame-diffs"/>),
                    so you might wish to fall back to TortoiseMerge in this case.

                    This is fine, but the selected row then also covers the

                                The default value is 3. With this setting, the
                                icons are grouped together by application type per working tree.
                                All dialogs from TortoiseGit of one working tree are grouped together,
                                all windows from TortoiseGitMerge of one working tree are grouped together, ...
                                For example, if you have
                                a log dialog and a push dialog open for working tree
                                <literal>C:\A</literal>, and a check-for-modifications

                                then there are two application icon groups shown
                                in the Win7 taskbar, one group for each working tree.
                                But TortoiseGitMerge windows are not grouped together
                                with TortoiseGit dialogs.

                                the setting set to 3, except that TortoiseGit, TortoiseGitMerge,
                                TortoiseGitBlame, TortoiseGitIDiff and TortoiseGitUDiff windows
                                of one working tree
                                are all grouped together. For example, if you have
                                the log dialog open and then double click on
                                a modified file, the opened TortoiseGitMerge diff window
                                will be put in the same icon group on the taskbar
                                as the log dialog icon.

                    TortoiseGit uses accelerators for its explorer context menu

                    accelerator, but so does the <literal>Copy</literal> entry

                    If you don't want or need the accelerators of the TortoiseGit

                    TortoiseGit checks whether there's a new version available
                    about once a week. If you don't want TortoiseGit to do this
                    check, set this value to <literal>false</literal>.
