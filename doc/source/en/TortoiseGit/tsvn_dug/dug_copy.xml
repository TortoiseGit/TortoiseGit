		It often happens that you already have the files you need in another
		project in your repository, and you simply want to copy them across.
		You could simply copy the files and add them as described above, but
		that would not give you any history. And if you subsequently fix a bug
		in the original files, you can only merge the fix automatically if the
		new copy is related to the original in Git.

		The easiest way to copy files and folders from within a working tree is
		to use the right-drag menu. When you <action>right-drag</action> a file
		or folder from one working tree to another, or even within the same
		folder, a context menu appears when you release the mouse.

		</figure>
		Now you can copy existing versioned content to a new location, possibly
		renaming it at the same time.
	</para>
	<para>
		You can also copy or move versioned files within a working tree, or between two
		working trees, using the familiar cut-and-paste method. Use the standard Windows
		<action>Copy</action> or <action>Cut</action> to copy one or more versioned items
		to the clipboard. If the clipboard contains such versioned items, you can then use
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		(note: not the standard Windows <action>Paste</action>)
		to copy or move those items to the new working tree location.
	</para>
-->
	<para>
		You can copy files and folders from your working tree to another
		location in the repository using
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Branch/Tag</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.

	<para>
		You can locate an older version of a file or folder in the log
		dialog and copy it to a new location in the repository directly
		from the log dialog using
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Create branch/tag from revision</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.
		Refer to <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-showlog-2"/> to find out more.

		You can also use the repository browser to locate content you want,
		and copy it into your working tree directly from the repository,
		or copy between two locations within the repository.
		Refer to <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-repobrowser"/> to find out more.

	<tip>
		<title>Cannot copy between repositories</title>
		<para>
			Whilst you can copy and files and folders <emphasis>within</emphasis>
			a repository, you <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> copy or move from one
			repository to another while preserving history using TortoiseGit.
			Not even if the repositories live on the same server. All you can
			do is copy the content in its current state and add it as new
			content to the second repository.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you are uncertain whether two URLs on the same server refer
			to the same or different repositories, use the repo browser to
			open one URL and find out where the repository root is.
			If you can see both locations in one repo browser window then
			they are in the same repository.
		</para>
