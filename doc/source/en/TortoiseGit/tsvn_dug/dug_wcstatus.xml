		<para>
			Now that you have checked out a working tree from a Git
			repository you can see your files in the windows explorer with
			changed icons. This is one of the reasons why TortoiseGit is so
			popular. TortoiseGit adds a so called overlay icon to each
			file icon which overlaps the original file icon. Depending on
			the Git status of the file the overlay icon is different.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/InGitIcon.png"/>
			A fresh checked out working tree has a green checkmark as overlay.
			That means the Git status is <emphasis>normal</emphasis>.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/ModifiedIcon.png"/>
			As soon as you start editing a file,
			the status changes to <emphasis>modified</emphasis>
			and the icon overlay then changes to a red exclamation
			mark. That way you can easily see which files were changed
			since you last updated your working tree and need to be committed.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/ConflictIcon.png"/>
			If during an update a <emphasis>conflict</emphasis> occurs then
			the icon changes to a yellow exclamation mark.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/ReadOnlyIcon.png"/> 
			Staged. If you use "git update-index" to tell git this file will be commited,
			Git makes that file staged.
		</para>
		<!--
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/LockedIcon.png"/> 
			If you hold a lock on a file, and the Git status is
			<emphasis>normal</emphasis>, this icon overlay reminds you that you
			should release the lock if you are not using it to allow others to
			commit their changes to the file.
		</para>
		-->
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/DeletedIcon.png"/> 
			This icon shows you that some files or folders inside the current folder
			have been scheduled to be <emphasis>deleted</emphasis> from version control
			or a file under version control is missing in a folder.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/AddedIcon.png"/> 
			The plus sign tells you that a file or folder has been scheduled to be
			<emphasis>added</emphasis> to version control.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/IgnoredIcon.png"/> 
			The bar sign tells you that a file or folder is
			<emphasis>ignored</emphasis> for version control purposes.
			This overlay is optional.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/UnversionedIcon.png"/> 
			This icon shows files and folders which are not under version control,
			but have not been ignored.
			This overlay is optional.
		</para>
		<para>
			In fact, you may find that not all of these icons are used on your system.
			This is because the number of overlays allowed by Windows is very limited
			and if you are also using an old version of TortoiseCVS, then there are
			not enough overlay slots available.
			TortoiseGit tries to be a <quote>Good Citizen (TM)</quote>
			and limits its use of overlays to give other apps a chance too.
		</para>
		<para>
			Now that there are more Tortoise clients around (TortoiseCVS, TortoiseHG, ...)
			the icon limit becomes a real problem. To work around this, the TortoiseSVN
			project introduced a common shared icon set, loaded as a DLL, which can be
			used by all Tortoise clients. Check with your client provider to see if
			this has been integrated yet :-)
		</para>

			status and other technical details, read

			The same information which is available from the icon overlays

		<para>
			Simply right click on one of the headings of a column, choose
			<guimenuitem>More...</guimenuitem> from the context menu displayed. A
			dialog will appear where you can specify the columns and their
			order, which is displayed in the <quote>Detailed View</quote>. Scroll down
			until the entries starting with Git come into view. Check the
			ones you would like to have displayed and close the dialog by
			pressing <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. The columns will be appended
			to the right of those currently displayed. You can reorder them by
			drag and drop, or resize them, so that they fit your needs.
		</para>

			<para>The additional columns in the Windows Explorer are not

					<guimenuitem>Repair Move</guimenuitem>

			Often you want to look inside your files, to have a look at what

			has changed, and selecting <guimenuitem>Diff</guimenuitem> from
			TortoiseGit's context menu. This starts the external
			diff-viewer, which will then compare the current file with the
