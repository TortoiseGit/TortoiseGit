		One of the commonest requirements in project development is to
		see what has changed. You might want to look at the differences
		between two revisions of the same file, or the differences between
		two separate files.
		TortoiseGit provides a built-in tool named 
		<application>TortoiseMerge</application> for viewing differences of
		text files. For viewing differences of image files, TortoiseGit
		also has a tool named <application>TortoiseIDiff</application>.
		Of course, you can use your own favourite diff program if you
		like.

		<para>
			There are many tools available for diffing text files, including our
			own TortoiseMerge, but we often find ourselves wanting to see how
			an image file has changed too. That's why we created TortoiseIDiff.
		</para>

			</menuchoice>
			for any of the common image file formats will start TortoiseIDiff
			to show image differences. By default the images are displayed side-by-side
			but you can use the View menu or toolbar to switch to a top-bottom
			view instead, or if you prefer, you can overlay the images and pretend
			you are using a lightbox.
		</para>
		<para>
			Naturally you can also zoom in and out and pan around the image.
			You can also pan the image simply by left-dragging it.
			If you select the <guilabel>Link images together</guilabel> option,
			then the pan controls (scrollbars, mousewheel) on both images are linked.
		</para>
		<para>
			An image info box shows details about the image file, such as the
			size in pixels, resolution and colour depth. If this box gets in the
			way, use
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>View</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Image Info</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>
			to hide it.
			You can get the same information in a tooltip if you hover the mouse
			over the image title bar.
		</para>
		<para>
			When the images are overlaid, the relative intensity of the images
			(alpha blend) is controlled by a slider control at the left side.
			You can click anywhere in the slider to set the blend directly, or you
			can drag the slider to change the blend interactively.
			<keycap>Ctrl+Shift</keycap>-<action>Wheel</action> to change the blend.
		</para>
		<para>
			The button above the slider toggles between two preset blends, indicated
			by the markers on either side of the blend slider. By default one is at
			the top and the other at the bottom, so the toggle button just switches
			between one image and the other. You can move the markers to choose
			the two blend values that the toggle button will use.
		</para>
		<para>
			Sometimes you want to see a difference rather than a blend. You might
			have the image files for two revisions of a printed circuit board and
			want to see which tracks have changed. If you disable alpha blend mode,
			the difference will be shown as an <emphasis>XOR</emphasis> of the pixel
			colour values. Unchanged areas will be plain white and changes will be
			coloured.
