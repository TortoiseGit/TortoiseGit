	<para>
		Once in a while, you will get a <emphasis>conflict</emphasis> when
		you update your files from the repository. A conflict
		occurs when two or more developers have changed the same
		few lines of a file. As Subversion knows nothing of your
		project, it leaves resolving the conflicts to the developers.
		Whenever a conflict is reported, you should open the file in
		question, and search for lines starting with the string
		<literal>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</literal>.
		The conflicting area is marked like this:
<screen>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; filename
    your changes
=======
    code merged from repository
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; revision
</screen>
		Also, for every conflicted file Subversion places three
		additional files in your directory:
		<variablelist>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>filename.ext.mine</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						This is your file as it existed in your
						working copy before you updated your working copy
						- that is, without conflict markers. This file has
						your latest changes in it and nothing else.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>filename.ext.rOLDREV</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						This is the file that was the BASE
						revision before you updated your working copy. That is,
						it the file that you checked out before you made
						your latest edits.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>filename.ext.rNEWREV</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						This is the file that your Subversion
						client just received from the server when you updated
						your working copy. This file corresponds to the HEAD
						revision of the repository.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
		</variablelist>
	</para>
	<para>
		You can either launch an external merge tool / conflict
		editor with
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Edit Conflicts</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		or you can use any other editor to manually
		resolve the conflict. You should decide what the code
		should look like, do the necessary changes and save the file.
	</para>
	<para>
		Afterwards execute the command
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Resolved</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		and commit your modifications to the repository.
		Please note that the Resolve command does not really
		resolve the conflict. It just removes the
		<filename>filename.ext.mine</filename> and
		<filename>filename.ext.r*</filename> files,
		to allow you to commit your changes.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you have conflicts with binary files, Subversion does
		not attempt to merge the files itself. The local file remains
		unchanged (exactly as you last changed it) and you have
		<filename>filename.ext.r*</filename> files.
		If you want to discard your changes and keep the repository
		version, just use the Revert command. If you want to keep
		your version and overwrite the repository version, use the
		Resolved command, then commit your version.
	</para>
	<para>
		You can use the Resolved command for multiple files
		if you right click on the parent folder and select
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Resolved...</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		This will bring up a dialog listing all conflicted files
		in that folder, and you can select which ones to mark
		as resolved.
	</para>
