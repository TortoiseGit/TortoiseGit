				Since renames and moves are done as a delete followed by an

				part of the rename/move, it will stay behind in the repository
				and when your co-workers update, the old file will not be
				removed. i.e. they will have <emphasis>both</emphasis> the old

		<title>Repairing File Renames</title>
		<para>
			Sometimes your friendly IDE will rename files for you as part of a refactoring
			exercise, and of course it doesn't tell Git. If you try to commit your
			changes, Git will see the old filename as missing and the new one as
			an unversioned file. You could just check the new filename to get it added in,
			but you would then lose the history tracing, as Git does not know the
			files are related.
		</para>
		<para>
			A better way is to notify Git that this change is actually a rename,
			and you can do this within the <guilabel>Commit</guilabel> and
			<guilabel>Check for Modifications</guilabel> dialogs.
			Simply select both the old name (missing) and the new name (unversioned)
			and use
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Repair Move</guimenuitem>

			Usually you set your ignore list such that all generated files are ignored
