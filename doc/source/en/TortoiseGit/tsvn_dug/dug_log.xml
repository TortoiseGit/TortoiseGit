		For every change you make and commit, you should provide
		a log message for that change. That way you can later find out
		what changes you made and why, and you have a detailed log for
		your development process.
	</para>
	<para>
		The Revision Log Dialog retrieves all those log messages and shows them
		to you.
		The display is divided into 3 panes.
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The top pane shows a list of revisions where changes to the
					file/folder have been committed. This summary includes the
					date and time, the person who committed the revision and the
					start of the log message.
				</para>
				<para>
					Lines shown in bold indicate that that is HEAD commit.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The middle pane shows the full log message for the selected
					revision.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The bottom pane shows a list of all files and folders that
					were changed as part of the selected revision.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		But it does much more than that - it provides context menu
		commands which you can use to get even more information about the
		project history.

						When the <guilabel>Stop on copy/rename</guilabel>

		<title>Current Working Tree Revision</title>
		<para>
			Because the log dialog shows you the log from HEAD, not from the
			current working tree revision, it often happens that there are
			log messages shown for content which has not yet been updated
			in your working tree. To help make this clearer, the commit
			message which corresponds to the revision you have in your
			working tree is shown in bold.
		</para>
		<para>
			By default this only works for files. This is because the
			update revision for a folder may not correspond to the update
			revision of its content, and the only way to find the effective
			update revision for the folder is to crawl the working tree.
			This can be a slow operation for large working trees so if
			you want to enable this feature you must create a
			<literal>DWORD</literal> registry key with value 1 at
			<literal>HKCU\Software\TortoiseGit\RecursiveLogRev</literal>.

			For example, if you develop a new feature on a branch and then merge

			the trunk log as a single commit for the merge, even though there
			may have been 1000 commits during branch development.

			Of course, merging is never simple! During feature development on the

			keep the branch in sync with the main line code. So the merge history
			of the branch will also include another layer of merge history.
			These different layers are shown in the log dialog using indentation

			If you want to restrict the log messages to show only those

			to restrict the output to a known date range. The search

			particular phrase.
		</para>

			Click on the search icon to select which information you want
			to search in, and to choose <emphasis>regex</emphasis> mode.
			Normally you will only need a simple text search, but if you
			need to more flexible search terms, you can use regular expressions.
			If you hover the mouse over the box, a tooltip will give hints
			on how to use the regex functions.
			You can also find online documentation and a tutorial at
			<ulink url="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">
				<citetitle>http://www.regular-expressions.info/</citetitle>

			The filter works by checking whether your filter string matches

			the filter string are shown.
		</para>
		<para>
			To make the filter show all log entries that do <emphasis>not</emphasis>

			show those entries which were not committed by <literal>username</literal>.

			<guilabel>Hide unrelated changed paths</guilabel> checkbox.
			Related paths are those which contain the path used to display

			in that folder or below it. For a file it means just that one file.
