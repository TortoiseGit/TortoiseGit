				the commit dialog will select the changed files automatically.
				If you forget about a new file you created, committing the
				folder will find it anyway. Committing a folder does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
				mean that every file gets marked as changed; It just makes
				your life easier by doing more work for you.

			<title>Many unversioned files in the commit dialog</title>

				If you think that the commit dialog shows you too

				files, there are several ways to handle this. You can:
				<itemizedlist>
					<!--
					<listitem>
						<para>
							add the file (or a wildcard extension)
							to the list of files to exclude on the settings page.
							This will affect every working copy you have.
						</para>
					</listitem>
					-->
					<listitem>
						<para>
							add the file to the <literal>.gitignore</literal> list
							using
							<menuchoice>
								<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
								<guimenuitem>Add to ignore list</guimenuitem>
							</menuchoice>
							<!--
							This will only affect the directory on
							which you set the <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property.
							Using the SVN Property Dialog, you can alter the
							<literal>svn:ignore</literal> property for a directory.

			<action>Double clicking</action> on any modified file in the commit
			dialog will launch the external diff tool to show your changes.
			The context menu will give you more options, as shown in the screenshot.

				explorer windows open to look at distant folders of the
				hierarchy. If you want to avoid committing from the top
				level folder (with a lengthy folder crawl to check for changes)
				you can open the commit dialog for one folder and drag in items
				from the other windows to include within the same atomic commit.
			</para>

			<title>Repairing External Renames</title>
			<para>
				Sometimes files get renamed outside of Git, and they show up
				in the file list as a missing file and an unversioned file. To avoid
				losing the history you need to notify Git about the connection.
				Simply select both the old name (missing) and the new name (unversioned)
				and use
				<menuchoice>
					<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
					<guimenuitem>Repair Move</guimenuitem>

		<title>Excluding Items from the Commit List</title>
		<para>
			Sometimes you have versioned files that change frequently but that you
			really don't want to commit. Sometimes this indicates a flaw in your
			build process - why are those files versioned? should you be using
			template files? But occasionally it is inevitable. A classic reason
			is that your IDE changes a timestamp in the project file every time
			you build. The project file has to be versioned as it includes all the
			build settings, but it doesn't need to be committed just because the
			timestamp changed.
		</para>
		<para>
			To help out in awkward cases like this, we have reserved a changelist
			called <literal>ignore-on-commit</literal>. Any file added to this
			changelist will automatically be unchecked in the commit dialog.
			You can still commit changes, but you have to select it manually
			in the commit dialog.

	<sect2 id="tsvn-dug-commit-restore">
		<title>Commit only parts of files</title>
		<para>
			Sometimes you want to only commit parts of the changes
			you made to a file. Such a situation usually happens when
			you're working on something but then an urgent fix needs
			to be committed, and that fix happens to be in the same file
			you're working on.

			<action>right click</action> on the file and use
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Restore after commit</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>.
			This will create a copy of the file as it is. Then you
			can edit the file, e.g. in TortoiseMerge and undo all
			the changes you don't want to commit. After saving those
			changes you can commit the file.

		<title>Commit Log Messages</title>
		<para>
			Be sure to enter a log message which describes the changes you are
			committing. This will help you to see what happened and when, as you
			browse through the project log messages at a later date. The message
			can be as long or as brief as you like; many projects have guidelines
			for what should be included, the language to use, and sometimes even
			a strict format.
		</para>
		<para>
			You can apply simple formatting to your log messages using a convention
			similar to that used within emails.
			To apply styling to <literal>text</literal>, use
			<literal>*text*</literal> for bold,

				<title>The Commit Dialog Spellchecker</title>
				<graphic fileref="../images/CommitSpellcheck.png"/>
			</figure>
			TortoiseGit includes a spellchecker to help you get your log messages
			right. This will highlight any mis-spelled words. Use the context menu
			to access the suggested corrections. Of course, it doesn't know
			<emphasis>every</emphasis> technical term that you do, so correctly
			spelt words will sometimes show up as errors. But don't worry. You can
			just add them to your personal dictionary using the context menu.
		</para>
		<para>
			The log message window also includes a filename and function auto-completion
			facility. This uses regular expressions to extract class and function names
			from the (text) files you are committing, as well as the filenames themselves.
			If a word you are typing matches anything in the list (after you have typed at
			least 3 characters, or pressed <keycap>Ctrl+Space</keycap>),
			a drop-down appears allowing you to select the full name.
			The regular expressions supplied with TortoiseGit are held in the TortoiseGit
			installation <filename>bin</filename> folder. You can also define your own
			regexes and store them in <filename>%APPDATA%\TortoiseGit\autolist.txt</filename>.
			Of course your private autolist will not be overwritten when you update your
			installation of TortoiseGit. If you are unfamiliar with regular expressions,
			take a look at the introduction at
			<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
