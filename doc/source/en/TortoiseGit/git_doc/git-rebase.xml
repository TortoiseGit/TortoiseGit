<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<simpara>If <emphasis>&lt;branch&gt;</emphasis> is specified, <emphasis>git rebase</emphasis> will perform an automatic
<emphasis>git switch &lt;branch&gt;</emphasis> before doing anything else.  Otherwise
it remains on the current branch.</simpara>
<simpara>If <emphasis>&lt;upstream&gt;</emphasis> is not specified, the upstream configured in
<emphasis>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</emphasis> and <emphasis>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</emphasis> options will be used (see
<xref linkend="git-config(1)" /> for details) and the <emphasis>--fork-point</emphasis> option is
assumed.  If you are currently not on any branch or if the current
branch does not have a configured upstream, the rebase will abort.</simpara>
<simpara>All changes made by commits in the current branch but that are not
in <emphasis>&lt;upstream&gt;</emphasis> are saved to a temporary area.  This is the same set
of commits that would be shown by <emphasis>git log &lt;upstream&gt;..HEAD</emphasis>; or by
<emphasis>git log 'fork_point'..HEAD</emphasis>, if <emphasis>--fork-point</emphasis> is active (see the
description on <emphasis>--fork-point</emphasis> below); or by <emphasis>git log HEAD</emphasis>, if the
<emphasis>--root</emphasis> option is specified.</simpara>
<simpara>The current branch is reset to <emphasis>&lt;upstream&gt;</emphasis> or <emphasis>&lt;newbase&gt;</emphasis> if the
<emphasis>--onto</emphasis> option was supplied.  This has the exact same effect as
<emphasis>git reset --hard &lt;upstream&gt;</emphasis> (or <emphasis>&lt;newbase&gt;</emphasis>). <emphasis>ORIG_HEAD</emphasis> is set
to point at the tip of the branch before the reset.</simpara>
<note><simpara><emphasis>ORIG_HEAD</emphasis> is not guaranteed to still point to the previous branch tip
at the end of the rebase if other commands that write that pseudo-ref
(e.g. <emphasis>git reset</emphasis>) are used during the rebase. The previous branch tip,
however, is accessible using the reflog of the current branch
(i.e. <emphasis>@{1}</emphasis>, see <xref linkend="gitrevisions(7)" />).</simpara></note>
<simpara>The commits that were previously saved into the temporary area are
then reapplied to the current branch, one by one, in order. Note that
any commits in <emphasis>HEAD</emphasis> which introduce the same textual changes as a commit
in <emphasis>HEAD..&lt;upstream&gt;</emphasis> are omitted (i.e., a patch already accepted upstream
with a different commit message or timestamp will be skipped).</simpara>
<simpara>It is possible that a merge failure will prevent this process from being
completely automatic.  You will have to resolve any such merge failure
and run <emphasis>git rebase --continue</emphasis>.  Another option is to bypass the commit
that caused the merge failure with <emphasis>git rebase --skip</emphasis>.  To check out the
original <emphasis>&lt;branch&gt;</emphasis> and remove the <emphasis>.git/rebase-apply</emphasis> working files, use
the command <emphasis>git rebase --abort</emphasis> instead.</simpara>
<simpara>Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "topic":</simpara>
<screen>          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---F---G master</screen>
<simpara>From this point, the result of either of the following commands:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git rebase master
git rebase master topic</literallayout>
<simpara>would be:</simpara>
<screen>                  A'--B'--C' topic
                 /
    D---E---F---G master</screen>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">NOTE:</emphasis> The latter form is just a short-hand of <emphasis>git checkout topic</emphasis>
followed by <emphasis>git rebase master</emphasis>. When rebase exits <emphasis>topic</emphasis> will
remain the checked-out branch.</simpara>
<simpara>If the upstream branch already contains a change you have made (e.g.,
because you mailed a patch which was applied upstream), then that commit
will be skipped and warnings will be issued (if the <emphasis>merge</emphasis> backend is
used).  For example, running <emphasis>git rebase master</emphasis> on the following
history (in which <emphasis>A'</emphasis> and <emphasis>A</emphasis> introduce the same set of changes, but
have different committer information):</simpara>
<screen>          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---A'---F master</screen>
<simpara>will result in:</simpara>
<screen>                   B'---C' topic
                  /
    D---E---A'---F master</screen>
<simpara>Here is how you would transplant a topic branch based on one
branch to another, to pretend that you forked the topic branch
from the latter branch, using <emphasis>rebase --onto</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>First let's assume your <emphasis>topic</emphasis> is based on branch <emphasis>next</emphasis>.
For example, a feature developed in <emphasis>topic</emphasis> depends on some
functionality which is found in <emphasis>next</emphasis>.</simpara>
<screen>    o---o---o---o---o  master
         \
          o---o---o---o---o  next
                           \
                            o---o---o  topic</screen>
<simpara>We want to make <emphasis>topic</emphasis> forked from branch <emphasis>master</emphasis>; for example,
because the functionality on which <emphasis>topic</emphasis> depends was merged into the
more stable <emphasis>master</emphasis> branch. We want our tree to look like this:</simpara>
<screen>    o---o---o---o---o  master
        |            \
        |             o'--o'--o'  topic
         \
          o---o---o---o---o  next</screen>
<simpara>We can get this using the following command:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git rebase --onto master next topic</literallayout>
<simpara>Another example of --onto option is to rebase part of a
branch.  If we have the following situation:</simpara>
<screen>                            H---I---J topicB
                           /
                  E---F---G  topicA
                 /
    A---B---C---D  master</screen>
<simpara>then the command</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git rebase --onto master topicA topicB</literallayout>
<simpara>would result in:</simpara>
<screen>                 H'--I'--J'  topicB
                /
                | E---F---G  topicA
                |/
    A---B---C---D  master</screen>
<simpara>This is useful when topicB does not depend on topicA.</simpara>
<simpara>A range of commits could also be removed with rebase.  If we have
the following situation:</simpara>
<screen>    E---F---G---H---I---J  topicA</screen>
<simpara>then the command</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git rebase --onto topicA~5 topicA~3 topicA</literallayout>
<simpara>would result in the removal of commits F and G:</simpara>
<screen>    E---H'---I'---J'  topicA</screen>
<simpara>This is useful if F and G were flawed in some way, or should not be
part of topicA.  Note that the argument to <emphasis>--onto</emphasis> and the <emphasis>&lt;upstream&gt;</emphasis>
parameter can be any valid commit-ish.</simpara>
<simpara>In case of conflict, <emphasis>git rebase</emphasis> will stop at the first problematic commit
and leave conflict markers in the tree.  You can use <emphasis>git diff</emphasis> to locate
the markers (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;) and make edits to resolve the conflict.  For each
file you edit, you need to tell Git that the conflict has been resolved,
typically this would be done with</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git add &lt;filename&gt;</literallayout>
<simpara>After resolving the conflict manually and updating the index with the
desired resolution, you can continue the rebasing process with</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git rebase --continue</literallayout>
<simpara>Alternatively, you can undo the <emphasis>git rebase</emphasis> with</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git rebase --abort</literallayout>

<simpara>This option is useful in the case where one is developing a feature on
top of an upstream branch. While the feature is being worked on, the
upstream branch may advance and it may not be the best idea to keep
rebasing on top of the upstream but to keep the base commit as-is. As
the base commit is unchanged this option implies <emphasis>--reapply-cherry-picks</emphasis>
to avoid losing commits.</simpara>
<simpara>Although both this option and <emphasis>--fork-point</emphasis> find the merge base between
<emphasis>&lt;upstream&gt;</emphasis> and <emphasis>&lt;branch&gt;</emphasis>, this option uses the merge base as the <emphasis>starting

        How to handle commits that are not empty to start and are not
        clean cherry-picks of any upstream commit, but which become
        empty after rebasing (because they contain a subset of already
        upstream changes).  With drop (the default), commits that
        become empty are dropped.  With keep, such commits are kept.
        With ask (implied by <emphasis>--interactive</emphasis>), the rebase will halt when
        an empty commit is applied allowing you to choose whether to
        drop it, edit files more, or just commit the empty changes.
        Other options, like <emphasis>--exec</emphasis>, will use the default of drop unless
        <emphasis>-i</emphasis>/<emphasis>--interactive</emphasis> is explicitly specified.
</simpara>
<simpara>Note that commits which start empty are kept (unless <emphasis>--no-keep-empty</emphasis>
is specified), and commits which are clean cherry-picks (as determined
by <emphasis>git log --cherry-mark ...</emphasis>) are detected and dropped as a
preliminary step (unless <emphasis>--reapply-cherry-picks</emphasis> or <emphasis>--keep-base</emphasis> is
passed).</simpara>

<simpara>
        Do not keep commits that start empty before the rebase
        (i.e. that do not change anything from its parent) in the
        result.  The default is to keep commits which start empty,
        since creating such commits requires passing the <emphasis>--allow-empty</emphasis>
        override flag to <emphasis>git commit</emphasis>, signifying that a user is very
        intentionally creating such a commit and thus wants to keep
        it.
</simpara>
<simpara>Usage of this flag will probably be rare, since you can get rid of
commits that start empty by just firing up an interactive rebase and
removing the lines corresponding to the commits you don't want.  This
flag exists as a convenient shortcut, such as for cases where external
tools generate many empty commits and you want them all removed.</simpara>

        Reapply all clean cherry-picks of any upstream commit instead

        empty after rebasing, because they contain a subset of already
        upstream changes, the behavior towards them is controlled by
        the <emphasis>--empty</emphasis> flag.)
</simpara>
<simpara>In the absence of <emphasis>--keep-base</emphasis> (or if <emphasis>--no-reapply-cherry-picks</emphasis> is
given), these commits will be automatically dropped.  Because this
necessitates reading all upstream commits, this can be expensive in
repositories with a large number of upstream commits that need to be
read. When using the <emphasis>merge</emphasis> backend, warnings will be issued for each
dropped commit (unless <emphasis>--quiet</emphasis> is given). Advice will also be issued
unless <emphasis>advice.skippedCherryPicks</emphasis> is set to false (see

<simplesect id="git-rebase(1)__behavioral_differences">
<title>BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES</title>
<simpara><emphasis>git rebase</emphasis> has two primary backends: <emphasis>apply</emphasis> and <emphasis>merge</emphasis>.  (The <emphasis>apply</emphasis>
backend used to be known as the <emphasis>am</emphasis> backend, but the name led to
confusion as it looks like a verb instead of a noun.  Also, the <emphasis>merge</emphasis>
backend used to be known as the interactive backend, but it is now
used for non-interactive cases as well.  Both were renamed based on
lower-level functionality that underpinned each.) There are some
subtle differences in how these two backends behave:</simpara>
<section id="git-rebase(1)__empty_commits">
<title>Empty commits</title>
<simpara>The <emphasis>apply</emphasis> backend unfortunately drops intentionally empty commits, i.e.
commits that started empty, though these are rare in practice.  It
also drops commits that become empty and has no option for controlling
this behavior.</simpara>
<simpara>The <emphasis>merge</emphasis> backend keeps intentionally empty commits by default (though
with <emphasis>-i</emphasis> they are marked as empty in the todo list editor, or they can
be dropped automatically with <emphasis>--no-keep-empty</emphasis>).</simpara>
<simpara>Similar to the apply backend, by default the merge backend drops
commits that become empty unless <emphasis>-i</emphasis>/<emphasis>--interactive</emphasis> is specified (in
which case it stops and asks the user what to do).  The merge backend
also has an <emphasis>--empty={drop,keep,ask}</emphasis> option for changing the behavior
of handling commits that become empty.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="git-rebase(1)__directory_rename_detection">
<title>Directory rename detection</title>
<simpara>Due to the lack of accurate tree information (arising from
constructing fake ancestors with the limited information available in
patches), directory rename detection is disabled in the <emphasis>apply</emphasis> backend.
Disabled directory rename detection means that if one side of history
renames a directory and the other adds new files to the old directory,
then the new files will be left behind in the old directory without
any warning at the time of rebasing that you may want to move these
files into the new directory.</simpara>
<simpara>Directory rename detection works with the <emphasis>merge</emphasis> backend to provide you
warnings in such cases.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="git-rebase(1)__context">
<title>Context</title>
<simpara>The <emphasis>apply</emphasis> backend works by creating a sequence of patches (by calling
<emphasis>format-patch</emphasis> internally), and then applying the patches in sequence
(calling <emphasis>am</emphasis> internally).  Patches are composed of multiple hunks,
each with line numbers, a context region, and the actual changes.  The
line numbers have to be taken with some fuzz, since the other side
will likely have inserted or deleted lines earlier in the file.  The
context region is meant to help find how to adjust the line numbers in
order to apply the changes to the right lines.  However, if multiple
areas of the code have the same surrounding lines of context, the
wrong one can be picked.  There are real-world cases where this has
caused commits to be reapplied incorrectly with no conflicts reported.
Setting <emphasis>diff.context</emphasis> to a larger value may prevent such types of
problems, but increases the chance of spurious conflicts (since it
will require more lines of matching context to apply).</simpara>
<simpara>The <emphasis>merge</emphasis> backend works with a full copy of each relevant file,
insulating it from these types of problems.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="git-rebase(1)__labelling_of_conflicts_markers">
<title>Labelling of conflicts markers</title>
<simpara>When there are content conflicts, the merge machinery tries to
annotate each side's conflict markers with the commits where the
content came from.  Since the <emphasis>apply</emphasis> backend drops the original
information about the rebased commits and their parents (and instead
generates new fake commits based off limited information in the
generated patches), those commits cannot be identified; instead it has
to fall back to a commit summary.  Also, when <emphasis>merge.conflictStyle</emphasis> is
set to <emphasis>diff3</emphasis> or <emphasis>zdiff3</emphasis>, the <emphasis>apply</emphasis> backend will use "constructed merge
base" to label the content from the merge base, and thus provide no
information about the merge base commit whatsoever.</simpara>
<simpara>The <emphasis>merge</emphasis> backend works with the full commits on both sides of history
and thus has no such limitations.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="git-rebase(1)__hooks">
<title>Hooks</title>
<simpara>The <emphasis>apply</emphasis> backend has not traditionally called the post-commit hook,
while the <emphasis>merge</emphasis> backend has.  Both have called the post-checkout hook,
though the <emphasis>merge</emphasis> backend has squelched its output.  Further, both
backends only call the post-checkout hook with the starting point
commit of the rebase, not the intermediate commits nor the final
commit.  In each case, the calling of these hooks was by accident of
implementation rather than by design (both backends were originally
implemented as shell scripts and happened to invoke other commands
like <emphasis>git checkout</emphasis> or <emphasis>git commit</emphasis> that would call the hooks).  Both
backends should have the same behavior, though it is not entirely
clear which, if any, is correct.  We will likely make rebase stop
calling either of these hooks in the future.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="git-rebase(1)__interruptability">
<title>Interruptability</title>
<simpara>The <emphasis>apply</emphasis> backend has safety problems with an ill-timed interrupt; if
the user presses Ctrl-C at the wrong time to try to abort the rebase,
the rebase can enter a state where it cannot be aborted with a
subsequent <emphasis>git rebase --abort</emphasis>.  The <emphasis>merge</emphasis> backend does not appear to
suffer from the same shortcoming.  (See
<ulink url="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200207132152.GC2868@szeder.dev/">https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200207132152.GC2868@szeder.dev/</ulink> for
details.)</simpara>
</section>
<section id="git-rebase(1)__commit_rewording">
<title>Commit Rewording</title>
<simpara>When a conflict occurs while rebasing, rebase stops and asks the user
to resolve.  Since the user may need to make notable changes while
resolving conflicts, after conflicts are resolved and the user has run
<emphasis>git rebase --continue</emphasis>, the rebase should open an editor and ask the
user to update the commit message.  The <emphasis>merge</emphasis> backend does this, while
the <emphasis>apply</emphasis> backend blindly applies the original commit message.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="git-rebase(1)__miscellaneous_differences">
<title>Miscellaneous differences</title>
<simpara>There are a few more behavioral differences that most folks would
probably consider inconsequential but which are mentioned for
completeness:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

  them to stderr.

<title>MERGE STRATEGIES</title>

<simpara>
        This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one
        branch.  This strategy can only resolve two heads using a
        3-way merge algorithm.  When there is more than one common
        ancestor that can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a merged
        tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference
        tree for the 3-way merge.  This has been reported to result in
        fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done
        on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel
        development history.  Additionally this strategy can detect
        and handle merges involving renames.  It does not make use of
        detected copies.  The name for this algorithm is an acronym
        ("Ostensibly Recursive's Twin") and came from the fact that it
        was written as a replacement for the previous default
        algorithm, <emphasis>recursive</emphasis>.

        For a binary file, the entire contents are taken from our side.

        This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
        algorithm.  When there is more than one common
        ancestor that can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a
        merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as
        the reference tree for the 3-way merge.  This has been
        reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without
        causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits
        taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history.
        Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving
        renames.  It does not make use of detected copies.  This was
        the default strategy for resolving two heads from Git v0.99.9k
        until v2.33.0.
</simpara>
<simpara>The <emphasis>recursive</emphasis> strategy takes the same options as <emphasis>ort</emphasis>.  However,

        This is a modified <emphasis>ort</emphasis> strategy. When merging trees A and

        ancestor tree.

</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default, <emphasis>ort</emphasis>),
if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted on one of the
branches, that change will be present in the merged result; some people find
this behavior confusing.  It occurs because only the heads and the merge base
are considered when performing a merge, not the individual commits.  The merge
algorithm therefore considers the reverted change as no change at all, and
substitutes the changed version instead.</simpara>

remove them (weeding out bad or otherwise unwanted patches).</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>
fix that
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
commit it
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>Sometimes the thing fixed in b.2. cannot be amended to the not-quite
perfect commit it fixes, because that commit is buried deeply in a
patch series.  That is exactly what interactive rebase is for: use it
after plenty of "a"s and "b"s, by rearranging and editing
commits, and squashing multiple commits into one.</simpara>
<simpara>Start it with the last commit you want to retain as-is:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git rebase -i &lt;after-this-commit&gt;</literallayout>
<simpara>An editor will be fired up with all the commits in your current branch
(ignoring merge commits), which come after the given commit.  You can
reorder the commits in this list to your heart's content, and you can
remove them.  The list looks more or less like this:</simpara>
<screen>pick deadbee The oneline of this commit
pick fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
...</screen>
<simpara>The oneline descriptions are purely for your pleasure; <emphasis>git rebase</emphasis> will
not look at them but at the commit names ("deadbee" and "fa1afe1" in this
example), so do not delete or edit the names.</simpara>
<simpara>By replacing the command "pick" with the command "edit", you can tell
<emphasis>git rebase</emphasis> to stop after applying that commit, so that you can edit
the files and/or the commit message, amend the commit, and continue
rebasing.</simpara>
<simpara>To interrupt the rebase (just like an "edit" command would do, but without
cherry-picking any commit first), use the "break" command.</simpara>
<simpara>If you just want to edit the commit message for a commit, replace the
command "pick" with the command "reword".</simpara>
<simpara>To drop a commit, replace the command "pick" with "drop", or just
delete the matching line.</simpara>
<simpara>If you want to fold two or more commits into one, replace the command
"pick" for the second and subsequent commits with "squash" or "fixup".
If the commits had different authors, the folded commit will be
attributed to the author of the first commit.  The suggested commit
message for the folded commit is the concatenation of the first
commit's message with those identified by "squash" commands, omitting the
messages of commits identified by "fixup" commands, unless "fixup -c"
is used.  In that case the suggested commit message is only the message
of the "fixup -c" commit, and an editor is opened allowing you to edit
the message.  The contents (patch) of the "fixup -c" commit are still
incorporated into the folded commit. If there is more than one "fixup -c"
commit, the message from the final one is used.  You can also use
"fixup -C" to get the same behavior as "fixup -c" except without opening
an editor.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>git rebase</emphasis> will stop when "pick" has been replaced with "edit" or
when a command fails due to merge errors. When you are done editing
and/or resolving conflicts you can continue with <emphasis>git rebase --continue</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, if you want to reorder the last 5 commits, such that what
was <emphasis>HEAD~4</emphasis> becomes the new <emphasis>HEAD</emphasis>. To achieve that, you would call
<emphasis>git rebase</emphasis> like this:</simpara>
<screen>$ git rebase -i HEAD~5</screen>
<simpara>And move the first patch to the end of the list.</simpara>
<simpara>You might want to recreate merge commits, e.g. if you have a history
like this:</simpara>
<screen>           X
            \
         A---M---B
        /
---o---O---P---Q</screen>
<simpara>Suppose you want to rebase the side branch starting at "A" to "Q". Make
sure that the current <emphasis>HEAD</emphasis> is "B", and call</simpara>
<screen>$ git rebase -i -r --onto Q O</screen>
<simpara>Reordering and editing commits usually creates untested intermediate
steps.  You may want to check that your history editing did not break
anything by running a test, or at least recompiling at intermediate
points in history by using the "exec" command (shortcut "x").  You may
do so by creating a todo list like this one:</simpara>
<screen>pick deadbee Implement feature XXX
fixup f1a5c00 Fix to feature XXX
exec make
pick c0ffeee The oneline of the next commit
edit deadbab The oneline of the commit after
exec cd subdir; make test
...</screen>
<simpara>The interactive rebase will stop when a command fails (i.e. exits with
non-0 status) to give you an opportunity to fix the problem. You can
continue with <emphasis>git rebase --continue</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>The "exec" command launches the command in a shell (the one specified
in <emphasis>$SHELL</emphasis>, or the default shell if <emphasis>$SHELL</emphasis> is not set), so you can
use shell features (like "cd", "&gt;", ";" &#8230;). The command is run from
the root of the working tree.</simpara>
<screen>$ git rebase -i --exec "make test"</screen>
<simpara>This command lets you check that intermediate commits are compilable.
The todo list becomes like that:</simpara>
<screen>pick 5928aea one
exec make test
pick 04d0fda two
exec make test
pick ba46169 three
exec make test
pick f4593f9 four
exec make test</screen>
</simplesect>
<simplesect id="git-rebase(1)__splitting_commits">
<title>SPLITTING COMMITS</title>
<simpara>In interactive mode, you can mark commits with the action "edit".  However,
this does not necessarily mean that <emphasis>git rebase</emphasis> expects the result of this
edit to be exactly one commit.  Indeed, you can undo the commit, or you can
add other commits.  This can be used to split a commit into two:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Start an interactive rebase with <emphasis>git rebase -i &lt;commit&gt;^</emphasis>, where
  <emphasis>&lt;commit&gt;</emphasis> is the commit you want to split.  In fact, any commit range
  will do, as long as it contains that commit.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Mark the commit you want to split with the action "edit".
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
When it comes to editing that commit, execute <emphasis>git reset HEAD^</emphasis>.  The
  effect is that the <emphasis>HEAD</emphasis> is rewound by one, and the index follows suit.
  However, the working tree stays the same.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Now add the changes to the index that you want to have in the first
  commit.  You can use <emphasis>git add</emphasis> (possibly interactively) or
  <emphasis>git gui</emphasis> (or both) to do that.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Commit the now-current index with whatever commit message is appropriate
  now.

</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Continue the rebase with <emphasis>git rebase --continue</emphasis>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>If you are not absolutely sure that the intermediate revisions are
consistent (they compile, pass the testsuite, etc.) you should use
<emphasis>git stash</emphasis> to stash away the not-yet-committed changes
after each commit, test, and amend the commit if fixes are necessary.</simpara>
</simplesect>
<simplesect id="git-rebase(1)__recovering_from_upstream_rebase">
<title>RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE</title>
<simpara>Rebasing (or any other form of rewriting) a branch that others have
based work on is a bad idea: anyone downstream of it is forced to
manually fix their history.  This section explains how to do the fix
from the downstream's point of view.  The real fix, however, would be
to avoid rebasing the upstream in the first place.</simpara>
<simpara>To illustrate, suppose you are in a situation where someone develops a
<emphasis>subsystem</emphasis> branch, and you are working on a <emphasis>topic</emphasis> that is dependent
on this <emphasis>subsystem</emphasis>.  You might end up with a history like the
following:</simpara>
<screen>    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
         \
          o---o---o---o---o  subsystem
                           \
                            *---*---*  topic</screen>
<simpara>If <emphasis>subsystem</emphasis> is rebased against <emphasis>master</emphasis>, the following happens:</simpara>
<screen>    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
         \                       \
          o---o---o---o---o       o'--o'--o'--o'--o'  subsystem
                           \
                            *---*---*  topic</screen>
<simpara>If you now continue development as usual, and eventually merge <emphasis>topic</emphasis>
to <emphasis>subsystem</emphasis>, the commits from <emphasis>subsystem</emphasis> will remain duplicated forever:</simpara>
<screen>    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
         \                       \

                            *---*---*-..........-*--*  topic</screen>
<simpara>Such duplicates are generally frowned upon because they clutter up
history, making it harder to follow.  To clean things up, you need to
transplant the commits on <emphasis>topic</emphasis> to the new <emphasis>subsystem</emphasis> tip, i.e.,
rebase <emphasis>topic</emphasis>.  This becomes a ripple effect: anyone downstream from
<emphasis>topic</emphasis> is forced to rebase too, and so on!</simpara>

        a full history rewriting command like

correspond to the ones before the rebase.</simpara>
<note><simpara>While an "easy case recovery" sometimes appears to be successful

<simpara>The idea is to manually tell <emphasis>git rebase</emphasis> "where the old <emphasis>subsystem</emphasis>

between them was.  You will have to find a way to name the last commit
of the old <emphasis>subsystem</emphasis>, for example:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
With the <emphasis>subsystem</emphasis> reflog: after <emphasis>git fetch</emphasis>, the old tip of
  <emphasis>subsystem</emphasis> is at <emphasis>subsystem@{1}</emphasis>.  Subsequent fetches will
  increase the number.  (See <xref linkend="git-reflog(1)" />.)
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Relative to the tip of <emphasis>topic</emphasis>: knowing that your <emphasis>topic</emphasis> has three
  commits, the old tip of <emphasis>subsystem</emphasis> must be <emphasis>topic~3</emphasis>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>You can then transplant the old <emphasis>subsystem..topic</emphasis> to the new tip by
saying (for the reflog case, and assuming you are on <emphasis>topic</emphasis> already):</simpara>
<screen>    $ git rebase --onto subsystem subsystem@{1}</screen>
<simpara>The ripple effect of a "hard case" recovery is especially bad:
<emphasis>everyone</emphasis> downstream from <emphasis>topic</emphasis> will now have to perform a "hard
case" recovery too!</simpara>

<title>REBASING MERGES</title>
<simpara>The interactive rebase command was originally designed to handle
individual patch series. As such, it makes sense to exclude merge
commits from the todo list, as the developer may have merged the
then-current <emphasis>master</emphasis> while working on the branch, only to rebase
all the commits onto <emphasis>master</emphasis> eventually (skipping the merge
commits).</simpara>
<simpara>However, there are legitimate reasons why a developer may want to
recreate merge commits: to keep the branch structure (or "commit
topology") when working on multiple, inter-related branches.</simpara>
<simpara>In the following example, the developer works on a topic branch that
refactors the way buttons are defined, and on another topic branch
that uses that refactoring to implement a "Report a bug" button. The
output of <emphasis>git log --graph --format=%s -5</emphasis> may look like this:</simpara>

<simpara>The developer might want to rebase those commits to a newer <emphasis>master</emphasis>
while keeping the branch topology, for example when the first topic
branch is expected to be integrated into <emphasis>master</emphasis> much earlier than the
second one, say, to resolve merge conflicts with changes to the
DownloadButton class that made it into <emphasis>master</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>This rebase can be performed using the <emphasis>--rebase-merges</emphasis> option.
It will generate a todo list looking like this:</simpara>
<screen>label onto

# Branch: refactor-button
reset onto
pick 123456 Extract a generic Button class from the DownloadButton one
pick 654321 Use the Button class for all buttons
label refactor-button

# Branch: report-a-bug
reset refactor-button # Use the Button class for all buttons
pick abcdef Add the feedback button
label report-a-bug

reset onto
merge -C a1b2c3 refactor-button # Merge 'refactor-button'
merge -C 6f5e4d report-a-bug # Merge 'report-a-bug'</screen>
<simpara>In contrast to a regular interactive rebase, there are <emphasis>label</emphasis>, <emphasis>reset</emphasis>
and <emphasis>merge</emphasis> commands in addition to <emphasis>pick</emphasis> ones.</simpara>
<simpara>The <emphasis>label</emphasis> command associates a label with the current HEAD when that
command is executed. These labels are created as worktree-local refs
(<emphasis>refs/rewritten/&lt;label&gt;</emphasis>) that will be deleted when the rebase
finishes. That way, rebase operations in multiple worktrees linked to
the same repository do not interfere with one another. If the <emphasis>label</emphasis>
command fails, it is rescheduled immediately, with a helpful message how
to proceed.</simpara>
<simpara>The <emphasis>reset</emphasis> command resets the HEAD, index and worktree to the specified
revision. It is similar to an <emphasis>exec git reset --hard &lt;label&gt;</emphasis>, but
refuses to overwrite untracked files. If the <emphasis>reset</emphasis> command fails, it is
rescheduled immediately, with a helpful message how to edit the todo list
(this typically happens when a <emphasis>reset</emphasis> command was inserted into the todo
list manually and contains a typo).</simpara>
<simpara>The <emphasis>merge</emphasis> command will merge the specified revision(s) into whatever
is HEAD at that time. With <emphasis>-C &lt;original-commit&gt;</emphasis>, the commit message of
the specified merge commit will be used. When the <emphasis>-C</emphasis> is changed to
a lower-case <emphasis>-c</emphasis>, the message will be opened in an editor after a
successful merge so that the user can edit the message.</simpara>
<simpara>If a <emphasis>merge</emphasis> command fails for any reason other than merge conflicts (i.e.
when the merge operation did not even start), it is rescheduled immediately.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, the <emphasis>merge</emphasis> command will use the <emphasis>ort</emphasis> merge strategy for
regular merges, and <emphasis>octopus</emphasis> for octopus merges.  One can specify a
default strategy for all merges using the <emphasis>--strategy</emphasis> argument when
invoking rebase, or can override specific merges in the interactive
list of commands by using an <emphasis>exec</emphasis> command to call <emphasis>git merge</emphasis>
explicitly with a <emphasis>--strategy</emphasis> argument.  Note that when calling <emphasis>git
merge</emphasis> explicitly like this, you can make use of the fact that the
labels are worktree-local refs (the ref <emphasis>refs/rewritten/onto</emphasis> would
correspond to the label <emphasis>onto</emphasis>, for example) in order to refer to the
branches you want to merge.</simpara>
<simpara>Note: the first command (<emphasis>label onto</emphasis>) labels the revision onto which
the commits are rebased; The name <emphasis>onto</emphasis> is just a convention, as a nod
to the <emphasis>--onto</emphasis> option.</simpara>
<simpara>It is also possible to introduce completely new merge commits from scratch
by adding a command of the form <emphasis>merge &lt;merge-head&gt;</emphasis>. This form will
generate a tentative commit message and always open an editor to let the
user edit it. This can be useful e.g. when a topic branch turns out to
address more than a single concern and wants to be split into two or
even more topic branches. Consider this todo list:</simpara>
<screen>pick 192837 Switch from GNU Makefiles to CMake
pick 5a6c7e Document the switch to CMake
pick 918273 Fix detection of OpenSSL in CMake
pick afbecd http: add support for TLS v1.3
pick fdbaec Fix detection of cURL in CMake on Windows</screen>
<simpara>The one commit in this list that is not related to CMake may very well
have been motivated by working on fixing all those bugs introduced by
switching to CMake, but it addresses a different concern. To split this
branch into two topic branches, the todo list could be edited like this:</simpara>
<screen>label onto

pick afbecd http: add support for TLS v1.3
label tlsv1.3

reset onto
pick 192837 Switch from GNU Makefiles to CMake
pick 918273 Fix detection of OpenSSL in CMake
pick fdbaec Fix detection of cURL in CMake on Windows
pick 5a6c7e Document the switch to CMake
label cmake

reset onto
merge tlsv1.3
merge cmake</screen>

rebase.autoStash
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash entry
        before the operation begins, and apply it after the operation
        ends.  This means that you can run rebase on a dirty worktree.
        However, use with care: the final stash application after a
        successful rebase might result in non-trivial conflicts.
        This option can be overridden by the <emphasis>--no-autostash</emphasis> and
        <emphasis>--autostash</emphasis> options of <xref linkend="git-rebase(1)" />.

        If set to "warn", git rebase -i will print a warning if some

        rebase will still proceed. If set to "error", it will print
        the previous warning and stop the rebase, <emphasis>git rebase
        --edit-todo</emphasis> can then be used to correct the error. If set to
        "ignore", no checking is done.
        To drop a commit without warning or error, use the <emphasis>drop</emphasis>
        command in the todo list.
