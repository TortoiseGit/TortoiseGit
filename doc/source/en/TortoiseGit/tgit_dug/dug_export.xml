		Sometimes you may want a snapshot of a specific revision/commit, e.g. to create a zipped
		tarball of your source, or to export to a web server. for this TortoiseGit offers the command
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Export...</guimenuitem>

		Another way to export from a working tree is to <action>right drag</action>
		the working tree folder to another location and choose
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Git Export here</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		or
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Git Export all here</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.
		The second option includes the unversioned files as well.
	</para>
	<para>
		When exporting from a working tree,
		if the target folder already contains a folder of the same
		name as the one you are exporting, you will be given the option
		to overwrite the existing content, or to create a new folder with
		an automatically generated name, eg. <literal>Target (1)</literal>.

		<title>Exporting single files</title>
		<para>
			The export dialog does not allow exporting single files.
		</para>
		<para>
			To export single files with TortoiseGit, you have to use
			the repository browser (cf. <xref linkend="tgit-dug-repobrowser"/>) or log dialog (cf. <xref linkend="tgit-dug-showlog"/>).
			Simply drag the file(s) you want to export from the repository
			browser to where you want them in the explorer, or use the
			context menu in the repository browser to export the files.

		<title>Exporting a Change Tree</title>
		<para>
			If you want to export a copy of your project tree structure
			but containing only the files which have changed in a particular
			revision, or between any two revisions, use the compare revisions
			feature described in <xref linkend="tgit-dug-compare-revs"/>.

		<title>Removing a working tree from version control</title>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>unversion</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
			Sometimes you have a working tree which you want to convert back
			to a normal folder without the <literal>.svn</literal> directories.
			What you really need is an export-in-place command, that just
			removes the control directories rather than generating a new
			clean directory tree.
		</para>
		<para>
			The answer is surprisingly simple - export the folder to itself!
			TortoiseGit detects this special case and asks if you want to
			make the working tree unversioned. If you answer
			<emphasis>yes</emphasis> the control directories will be removed
			and you will have a plain, unversioned directory tree.
