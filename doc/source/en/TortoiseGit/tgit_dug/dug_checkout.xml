	<para>
		The Switch/Checkout dialog can be used to checkout a specific version to the working tree  (i.e., all files are updated to match their state of the selected version). Normally, a specific version will be represented by a (local) branch which is set as the current branch (cf. <xref linkend="tgit-dug-branchtag"/> and <xref linkend="Git User Manual_repositories-and-branches"/>).
	</para>
	<para>
		Select a git repository directory in windows explorer
		<action>Right click</action> to pop up the
		context menu and select the command
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Switch/Checkout...</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>,
		which brings up the following dialog box:

		If you enter a branch name at <guilabel>Create New Branch</guilabel>, a new branch will be created. Also, the new branch will be set as the current branch (HEAD).

		<title>Checkout Depth</title>
		<para>
			You can choose the <firstterm>depth</firstterm> you want to checkout,
			which allows you to specify the depth of recursion into child folders.
			If you want just a few sections of a large tree, You can checkout
			the top level folder only, then update selected folders recursively.
			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Fully recursive</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Checkout the entire tree, including all child folders
							and sub-folders.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Immediate children, including folders</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Checkout the specified directory, including all files
							and child folders, but do not populate the child folders.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Only file children</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Checkout the specified directory, including all files
							but do not checkout any child folders.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Only this item</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Checkout the directory only. Do not populate it with

						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

			If you check out a sparse working tree (i.e., by choosing something other
			than <literal>fully recursive</literal> for the checkout depth), you can
			fetch additional sub-folders by using the repository browser
			(<xref linkend="tgit-dug-repobrowser" />) or the check for modifications dialog
			(<xref linkend="tgit-dug-wcstatus-2" />).
		</para>
		<para>
			In the repository browser,
			<action>Right click</action> on the checked out folder, then use
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Repo-Browser</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>
			to bring up the repository browser. Find the sub-folder you would like
			to add to your working tree, then use
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Context menu</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Update item to revision...</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>
			That menu will only be visible if the selected item does not exist yet
			in your working tree, but the parent item does exist.
		</para>
		<para>
			In the check for modifications dialog, first click on the button
			<guibutton>Check repository</guibutton>. The dialog will show all
			the files and folders which are in the repository but which you
			have not checked out as <literal>remotely added</literal>.
			<action>Right click</action> on the folder(s) you would like to add
			to your working tree, then use
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Context menu</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Update</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>.
		</para>
		<para>
			This feature is very useful when you only want to checkout parts of a
			large tree, but you want the convenience of updating a single working
			copy. Suppose you have a large tree which has sub-folders
			<literal>Project01</literal> to <literal>Project99</literal>,
			and you only want to checkout
			<literal>Project03</literal>,
			<literal>Project25</literal> and
			<literal>Project76/SubProj</literal>.
			Use these steps:
		</para>
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Checkout the parent folder with depth
					<quote>Only this item</quote>
					You now have an empty top level folder.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Select the new folder and use
					<menuchoice>
						<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
						<guimenuitem>Repo browser</guimenuitem>
					</menuchoice>
					to display the repository content.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Right click on <literal>Project03</literal> and
					<menuchoice>
						<guimenu>Context menu</guimenu>
						<guimenuitem>Update item to revision...</guimenuitem>
					</menuchoice>.
					Keep the default settings and click on
					<guibutton>OK</guibutton>. You now have
					that folder fully populated.
				</para>
				<para>
					Repeat the same process for <literal>Project25</literal>.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Navigate to <literal>Project76/SubProj</literal> and
					do the same. This time note that the <literal>Project76</literal>
					folder has no content except for <literal>SubProj</literal>,
					which itself is fully populated. Git has created the
					intermediate folders for you without populating them.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		<tip>
			<title>Working tree depth cannot be reduced</title>
			<para>
				Once you have checked out a working tree to a particular
				depth you can increase that depth later to get more content.
				However you cannot reduce the depth again to remove content.
				That feature may be added in a later version of Git.
			</para>
		</tip>
		<tip>
			<title>Using an older server</title>
			<para>
				Pre-1.5 servers do not understand the working tree depth
				request, so they cannot always deal with requests efficiently.
				The command will still work, but an older server may send all
				the data, leaving the client to filter out what is not required,
				which may mean a lot of network traffic. If possible you should
				upgrade your server to 1.5.

			If you checkout/switch to a <guilabel>Tag</guilabel> or <guilabel>Commit</guilabel>,
			you should create a new branch. Otherwise you will
			work at "no branch" (detached HEAD state; i.e., there is no current branch, cf. <xref linkend="git-checkout(1)__detached_head"/>).
			This can be easily fixed by creating a branch at this version and switching to it.
