				If you have deleted a file or a folder and already committed
				that delete operation to the repository, then a normal 
				<menuchoice>
					<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
					<guimenuitem>Revert</guimenuitem>
				</menuchoice>
				can't bring it back anymore. But the file or folder is not
				lost at all. If you know the revision the file or folder got
				deleted (if you don't, use the log dialog to find out) open
				the repository browser and switch to that revision. Then select
				the file or folder you deleted, right-click and select
				<menuchoice>
					<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
					<guimenuitem>Revert to this revision</guimenuitem>
				</menuchoice>

		<para>
			Making case-only changes to a filename needs special attention,
			because Windows has a case-insensitive file system.
			Therefore just renaming a file using the rename command of the Explorer is likely not to work.
			It is important to rename it using Git in order to update the index to make it use the new filename.
			Use the <guimenuitem>Rename...</guimenuitem> command in the TortoiseGit submenu.

		<para>
			If the repository already contains two files with the same name
			but differing only in case (e.g. <filename>TEST.TXT</filename>
			and <filename>test.txt</filename>), you
			will not be able to commit, and only one of them can be checkout
			on a Windows client. Whilst Git (in general) supports case-sensitive
			filenames, Windows does not.
		</para>
		<para>
			This sometimes happens when two people commit, from separate
			working trees, files which happen to have
			the same name, but with a case difference. It can also happen
			when files are committed from a system with a case-sensitive
			file system, like Linux, or when just setting core.ignorecase to false (cf. <xref linkend="git-config(1)"/>).
		</para>

			Usually you set your ignore list such that all generated files are ignored
			in Git. But what if you want to clear all those ignored items to produce
			a clean build? Usually you would set that in your makefile, but if you are
			debugging the makefile, or changing the build system it is useful to have a way
			of clearing the decks.

			TortoiseGit provides just such an option using

				<guimenuitem>Clean up...</guimenuitem>

			in the explorer list pane (right pane) in order to see this in the
