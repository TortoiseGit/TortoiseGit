	Rebase is quite complex, it alters the history of a repository. Please make sure you understood its principles before using it (For hints where to find more information about Git and merging see <xref linkend="tgit-preface-readingguide"/>).

	Rebasing commits takes places from the bottom of the list to the top (in ascending order of the ID column). For example, "squash" means that the commit gets squashed/combined with the previous commit(s) which are located below in the list (with a lower ID).

			Instead of setting "pick", "skip", "edit", "squash" by using the context-menu, you can also use the following keys:
			<keycap>space</keycap>: shifts the state, <keycap>s</keycap>: skip, <keycap>e</keycap>: edit, <keycap>p</keycap>: pick, <keycap>q</keycap>: squash
		</para>

			There is a button that swaps branch and upstream.
			Assume you are currently working on <literal>master</literal> branch, 
			and wish to rebase <literal>feature</literal> branch onto <literal>master</literal>.
			Instead of switching to <literal>feature</literal> in advance, 
			select the commit of <literal>feature</literal> in log list, 
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Rebase</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>
			and click this swap button.
			TortoiseGit's rebase moves <literal>feature</literal> to <literal>master</literal> directly, then 
			cherry-picks the commits. This approach touches fewer files and runs faster.

			When preserving merge commits, re-ordering commits cannot be handled properly in all cases, see in known bugs of vanilla git rebase: <xref linkend="git-rebase(1)"/>.
