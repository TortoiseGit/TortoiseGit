		For every change you make and commit, you should provide
		a log message for that change. That way you can later find out
		what changes you made and why, and you have a detailed log for
		your development process.
	</para>
	<para>
		The Revision Log Dialog retrieves all those log messages and shows them
		to you.
		The display is divided into 3 panes.
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The top pane shows a list of revisions where changes to the
					file/folder have been committed. This summary includes the
					date and time, the person who committed the revision and the
					start of the log message.
				</para>
				<para>
					Lines shown in bold indicate that that is HEAD commit.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The middle pane shows the full log message for the selected
					revision.

					The bottom pane shows a list of all files and folders that
					were changed as part of the selected revision.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		But it does much more than that - it provides context menu
		commands which you can use to get even more information about the
		project history.

		<para>
			If you want to restrict the log messages to show only those
			you are interested in rather than scrolling through a list
			of hundreds, you can use the filter controls at the top of
			the Log Dialog. The start and end date controls allow you
			to restrict the output to a known date range. The search
			box allows you to show only messages which contain a
			particular phrase.
		</para>
		<para>
			Click on the search icon to select which information you want
			to search in, and to choose <emphasis>regex</emphasis> mode.
			Normally you will only need a simple text search, but if you
			need to more flexible search terms, you can use regular expressions.
			If you hover the mouse over the box, a tooltip will give hints
			on how to use the regex functions.
			You can also find online documentation and a tutorial at
			<ulink url="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">
				<citetitle>http://www.regular-expressions.info/</citetitle>
			</ulink>.
			The filter works by checking whether your filter string matches
			the log entries, and then only those entries which <emphasis>match</emphasis>
			the filter string are shown.
		</para>
		<para>
			To make the filter show all log entries that do <emphasis>not</emphasis>
			match the filter string, start the string with an exclamation mark ('!').
			For example, a filter string <literal>!username</literal> will only
			show those entries which were not committed by <literal>username</literal>.

		<title>Jumping to a Commit by its Hash</title>
		<para>
			If you want to jump to a commit with a particular hash, you may
			do so by pressing <keycap>Ctrl+V</keycap> or <keycap>Shift+Insert</keycap>
			(into any log dialog element other than the search box) to paste the hash
			from the clipboard. If it has the form of a valid commit hash, the log
			dialog will attempt to jump to it.
