/*
 * mpint_i.h: definitions used internally by the bignum code, and
 * also a few other vaguely-bignum-like places.
 */

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The assorted conditional definitions of BignumInt and multiply
 * macros used throughout the bignum code to treat numbers as arrays
 * of the most conveniently sized word for the target machine.
 * Exported so that other code (e.g. poly1305) can use it too.
 *
 * This code must export, in whatever ifdef branch it ends up in:
 *
 *  - two types: 'BignumInt' and 'BignumCarry'. BignumInt is an
 *    unsigned integer type which will be used as the base word size
 *    for all bignum operations. BignumCarry is an unsigned integer
 *    type used to hold the carry flag taken as input and output by
 *    the BignumADC macro (see below).
 *
 *  - five constant macros:
 *     + BIGNUM_INT_BITS, the number of bits in BignumInt,
 *     + BIGNUM_INT_BYTES, the number of bytes that works out to
 *     + BIGNUM_TOP_BIT, the BignumInt value consisting of only the top bit
 *     + BIGNUM_INT_MASK, the BignumInt value with all bits set
 *     + BIGNUM_INT_BITS_BITS, log to the base 2 of BIGNUM_INT_BITS.
 *
 *  - four statement macros: BignumADC, BignumMUL, BignumMULADD,
 *    BignumMULADD2. These do various kinds of multi-word arithmetic,
 *    and all produce two output values.
 *     * BignumADC(ret,retc,a,b,c) takes input BignumInt values a,b
 *       and a BignumCarry c, and outputs a BignumInt ret = a+b+c and
 *       a BignumCarry retc which is the carry off the top of that
 *       addition.
 *     * BignumMUL(rh,rl,a,b) returns the two halves of the
 *       double-width product a*b.
 *     * BignumMULADD(rh,rl,a,b,addend) returns the two halves of the
 *       double-width value a*b + addend.
 *     * BignumMULADD2(rh,rl,a,b,addend1,addend2) returns the two
 *       halves of the double-width value a*b + addend1 + addend2.
 *
 * Every branch of the main ifdef below defines the type BignumInt and
 * the value BIGNUM_INT_BITS_BITS. The other constant macros are
 * filled in by common code further down.
 *
 * Most branches also define a macro DEFINE_BIGNUMDBLINT containing a
 * typedef statement which declares a type _twice_ the length of a
 * BignumInt. This causes the common code further down to produce a
 * default implementation of the four statement macros in terms of
 * that double-width type, and also to defined BignumCarry to be
 * BignumInt.
 *
 * However, if a particular compile target does not have a type twice
 * the length of the BignumInt you want to use but it does provide
 * some alternative means of doing add-with-carry and double-word
 * multiply, then the ifdef branch in question can just define
 * BignumCarry and the four statement macros itself, and that's fine
 * too.
