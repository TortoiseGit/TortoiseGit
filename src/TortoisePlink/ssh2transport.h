/*
 * Enumeration of high-level classes of reason why we might need to do
 * a repeat key exchange. A full detailed reason in human-readable
 * string form for the Event Log is also provided, but this enum type
 * is used to discriminate between classes of reason that the code
 * needs to treat differently.
 *
 * RK_NONE == 0 is the value indicating that no rekey is currently
 * needed at all. RK_INITIAL indicates that we haven't even done the
 * _first_ key exchange yet. RK_SERVER indicates that we're rekeying
 * because the server asked for it, not because we decided it
 * ourselves. RK_NORMAL is the usual case. RK_GSS_UPDATE indicates
 * that we're rekeying because we've just got new GSSAPI credentials
 * (hence there's no point in doing a preliminary check for new GSS
 * creds, because we already know the answer); RK_POST_USERAUTH
 * indicates that _if_ we're going to need a post-userauth immediate
 * rekey for any reason, this is the moment to do it.
 *
 * So RK_POST_USERAUTH only tells the transport layer to _consider_
 * rekeying, not to definitely do it. Also, that one enum value is
 * special in that the user-readable reason text is passed in to the
 * transport layer as NULL, whereas fills in the reason text after it
 * decides whether it needs a rekey at all. In the other cases,
 * rekey_reason is passed in to the at the same time as rekey_class.
