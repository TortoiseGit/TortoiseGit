     * The exact reason why we _ignore_ this text, rather than
     * treating it as a port number, is unfortunately lost in the
     * mists of history: the commit which originally introduced this
     * change on 2001-05-06 was clear on _what_ it was doing but
     * didn't bother to explain _why_. But I [SGT, 2017-12-03] suspect
     * it has to do with priority order: what should a saved session
     * do if its CONF_host contains 'server.example.com:123' and its
     * CONF_port contains 456? If CONF_port contained the _default_
     * port number then it might be a good guess that the colon suffix
     * on the host name was intended to override that, but you don't
     * really want to get into making heuristic judgments on that
     * basis.
     *
     * (Then again, you could just as easily make the same argument
     * about whether a 'user@' prefix on the host name should override
     * CONF_username, which this code _does_ do. I don't have a good
     * answer, sadly. Both these pieces of behaviour have been around
     * for years and it would probably cause subtle breakage in all
     * sorts of long-forgotten scripting to go changing things around
     * now.)
     *
     * In order to protect unbracketed IPv6 address literals against
     * this treatment, we do not make this change at all if there's
     * _more_ than one (un-IPv6-bracketed) colon.
