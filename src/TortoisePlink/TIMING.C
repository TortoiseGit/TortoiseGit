/*
 * timing.c
 * 
 * This module tracks any timers set up by schedule_timer(). It
 * keeps all the currently active timers in a list; it informs the
 * front end of when the next timer is due to go off if that
 * changes; and, very importantly, it tracks the context pointers
 * passed to schedule_timer(), so that if a context is freed all
 * the timers associated with it can be immediately annulled.
 *
 *
 * The problem is that computer clocks aren't perfectly accurate.
 * The GETTICKCOUNT function returns a 32bit number that normally
 * increases by about 1000 every second. On windows this uses the PC's
 * interrupt timer and so is only accurate to around 20ppm.  On unix it's
 * a value that's calculated from the current UTC time and so is in theory
 * accurate in the long term but may jitter and jump in the short term.
 *
 * What PuTTY needs from these timers is simply a way of delaying the
 * calling of a function for a little while, if it's occasionally called a
 * little early or late that's not a problem. So to protect against clock
 * jumps schedule_timer records the time that it was called in the timer
 * structure. With this information the run_timers function can see when
 * the current GETTICKCOUNT value is after the time the event should be
 * fired OR before the time it was set. In the latter case the clock must
 * have jumped, the former is (probably) just the normal passage of time.
