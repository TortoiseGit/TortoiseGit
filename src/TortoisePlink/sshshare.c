 * Support for SSH connection sharing, i.e. permitting one PuTTY to

 */

/*
 * Discussion and technical documentation
 * ======================================
 *
 * The basic strategy for PuTTY's implementation of SSH connection
 * sharing is to have a single 'upstream' PuTTY process, which manages
 * the real SSH connection and all the cryptography, and then zero or
 * more 'downstream' PuTTYs, which never talk to the real host but
 * only talk to the upstream through local IPC (Unix-domain sockets or
 * Windows named pipes).
 *
 * The downstreams communicate with the upstream using a protocol
 * derived from SSH itself, which I'll document in detail below. In
 * brief, though: the downstream->upstream protocol uses a trivial
 * binary packet protocol (just length/type/data) to encapsulate
 * unencrypted SSH messages, and downstreams talk to the upstream more
 * or less as if it was an SSH server itself. (So downstreams can
 * themselves open multiple SSH channels, for example, by sending
 * multiple SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_OPENs; they can send CHANNEL_REQUESTs of
 * their choice within each channel, and they handle their own
 * WINDOW_ADJUST messages.)
 *
 * The upstream would ideally handle these downstreams by just putting
 * their messages into the queue for proper SSH-2 encapsulation and
 * encryption and sending them straight on to the server. However,
 * that's not quite feasible as written, because client-side channel
 * IDs could easily conflict (between multiple downstreams, or between
 * a downstream and the upstream). To protect against that, the
 * upstream rewrites the client-side channel IDs in messages it passes
 * on to the server, so that it's performing what you might describe
 * as 'channel-number NAT'. Then the upstream remembers which of its
 * own channel IDs are channels it's managing itself, and which are
 * placeholders associated with a particular downstream, so that when
 * replies come in from the server they can be sent on to the relevant
 * downstream (after un-NATting the channel number, of course).
 *
 * Global requests from downstreams are only accepted if the upstream
 * knows what to do about them; currently the only such requests are
 * the ones having to do with remote-to-local port forwarding (in
 * which, again, the upstream remembers that some of the forwardings
 * it's asked the server to set up were on behalf of particular
 * downstreams, and sends the incoming CHANNEL_OPENs to those
 * downstreams when connections come in).
 *
 * Other fiddly pieces of this mechanism are X forwarding and
 * (OpenSSH-style) agent forwarding. Both of these have a fundamental
 * problem arising from the protocol design: that the CHANNEL_OPEN
 * from the server introducing a forwarded connection does not carry
 * any indication of which session channel gave rise to it; so if
 * session channels from multiple downstreams enable those forwarding
 * methods, it's hard for the upstream to know which downstream to
 * send the resulting connections back to.
 *
 * For X forwarding, we can work around this in a really painful way
 * by using the fake X11 authorisation data sent to the server as part
 * of the forwarding setup: upstream ensures that every X forwarding
 * request carries distinguishable fake auth data, and then when X
 * connections come in it waits to see the auth data in the X11 setup
 * message before it decides which downstream to pass the connection
 * on to.
 *
 * For agent forwarding, that workaround is unavailable. As a result,
 * this system (and, as far as I can think of, any other system too)
 * has the fundamental constraint that it can only forward one SSH
 * agent - it can't forward two agents to different session channels.
 * So downstreams can request agent forwarding if they like, but if
 * they do, they'll get whatever SSH agent is known to the upstream
 * (if any) forwarded to their sessions.
 *
 * Downstream-to-upstream protocol
 * -------------------------------
 *
 * Here I document in detail the protocol spoken between PuTTY
 * downstreams and upstreams over local IPC. The IPC mechanism can
 * vary between host platforms, but the protocol is the same.
 *
 * The protocol commences with a version exchange which is exactly
 * like the SSH-2 one, in that each side sends a single line of text
 * of the form
 *
 *   <protocol>-<version>-<softwareversion> [comments] \r\n
 *
 * The only difference is that in real SSH-2, <protocol> is the string
 * "SSH", whereas in this protocol the string is
 * "SSHCONNECTION@putty.projects.tartarus.org".
 *
 * (The SSH RFCs allow many protocol-level identifier namespaces to be
 * extended by implementors without central standardisation as long as
 * they suffix "@" and a domain name they control to their new ids.
 * RFC 4253 does not define this particular name to be changeable at
 * all, but I like to think this is obviously how it would have done
 * so if the working group had foreseen the need :-)
 *
 * Thereafter, all data exchanged consists of a sequence of binary
 * packets concatenated end-to-end, each of which is of the form
 *
 *     uint32     length of packet, N
 *     byte[N]    N bytes of packet data
 *
 * and, since these are SSH-2 messages, the first data byte is taken
 * to be the packet type code.
 *
 * These messages are interpreted as those of an SSH connection, after
 * userauth completes, and without any repeat key exchange.
 * Specifically, any message from the SSH Connection Protocol is
 * permitted, and also SSH_MSG_IGNORE, SSH_MSG_DEBUG,
 * SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT and SSH_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED from the SSH Transport
 * Protocol.
 *
 * This protocol imposes a few additional requirements, over and above
 * those of the standard SSH Connection Protocol:
 *
 * Message sizes are not permitted to exceed 0x4010 (16400) bytes,
 * including their length header.
 *
 * When the server (i.e. really the PuTTY upstream) sends
 * SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN with channel type "x11", and the client
 * (downstream) responds with SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_CONFIRMATION, that
 * confirmation message MUST include an initial window size of at
 * least 256. (Rationale: this is a bit of a fudge which makes it
 * easier, by eliminating the possibility of nasty edge cases, for an
 * upstream to arrange not to pass the CHANNEL_OPEN on to downstream
 * until after it's seen the X11 auth data to decide which downstream
 * it needs to go to.)
