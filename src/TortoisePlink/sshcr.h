 * If these macros look impenetrable to you, you might find it helpful
 * to read
 * 
 *   https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html
 * 
 * which explains the theory behind these macros.
 * 
 * In particular, if you are getting `case expression not constant'
 * errors when building with MS Visual Studio, this is because MS's
 * Edit and Continue debugging feature causes their compiler to
 * violate ANSI C. To disable Edit and Continue debugging:
 * 
 *  - right-click ssh.c in the FileView
 *  - click Settings
 *  - select the C/C++ tab and the General category
 *  - under `Debug info:', select anything _other_ than `Program
 *    Database for Edit and Continue'.

 *
 *       while (!condition) { crReturn(whatever); }
 *
 * (or do-while in the case of crWaitUntil). But it's better to do it
 * directly by writing _once_ to crLine before first testing the
 * condition, because this way it's robust against the condition check
 * potentially freeing the entire coroutine state structure as a side
 * effect (as long as it also evaluates false if it does that),
 * because we don't write into crLine between the condition evaluating
 * to false and the 'return' statement.
