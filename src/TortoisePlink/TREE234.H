/*
 * Find an element e in a sorted 2-3-4 tree t. Returns NULL if not
 * found. e is always passed as the first argument to cmp, so cmp
 * can be an asymmetric function if desired. cmp can also be passed
 * as NULL, in which case the compare function from the tree proper
 * will be used.
 * 
 * Three of these functions are special cases of findrelpos234. The
 * non-`pos' variants lack the `index' parameter: if the parameter
 * is present and non-NULL, it must point to an integer variable
 * which will be filled with the numeric index of the returned
 * element.
 * 
 * The non-`rel' variants lack the `relation' parameter. This
 * parameter allows you to specify what relation the element you
 * provide has to the element you're looking for. This parameter
 * can be:
 * 
 *   REL234_EQ     - find only an element that compares equal to e
 *   REL234_LT     - find the greatest element that compares < e
 *   REL234_LE     - find the greatest element that compares <= e
 *   REL234_GT     - find the smallest element that compares > e
 *   REL234_GE     - find the smallest element that compares >= e
 * 
 * Non-`rel' variants assume REL234_EQ.
 * 
 * If `rel' is REL234_GT or REL234_LT, the `e' parameter may be
 * NULL. In this case, REL234_GT will return the smallest element
 * in the tree, and REL234_LT will return the greatest. This gives
 * an alternative means of iterating over a sorted tree, instead of
 * using index234:
 * 
 *   // to loop forwards
 *   for (p = NULL; (p = findrel234(tree, p, NULL, REL234_GT)) != NULL ;)
 *       consume(p);
 * 
 *   // to loop backwards
 *   for (p = NULL; (p = findrel234(tree, p, NULL, REL234_LT)) != NULL ;)
 *       consume(p);

/*
 * A more general search type still. Use search234_start() to
 * initialise one of these state structures; it will fill in
 * state->element with an element of the tree, and state->index with
 * the index of that element. If you don't like that element, call
 * search234_step, with direction == -1 if you want an element earlier
 * in the tree, or +1 if you want a later one.
 *
 * If either function returns state->element == NULL, then you've
 * narrowed the search to a point between two adjacent elements, so
 * there are no further elements left to return consistent with the
 * constraints you've imposed. In this case, state->index tells you
 * how many elements come before the point you narrowed down to. After
 * this, you mustn't call search234_step again (unless the state
 * structure is first reinitialised).
 *
 * The use of this search system is that you get both the candidate
 * element _and_ its index at every stage, so you can use both of them
 * to make your decision. Also, you can remember element pointers from
 * earlier in the search.
 *
 * The fields beginning with underscores are private to the
 * implementation, and only exposed so that clients can know how much
 * space to allocate for the structure as a whole. Don't modify them.
 * (Except that it's safe to copy the whole structure.)
