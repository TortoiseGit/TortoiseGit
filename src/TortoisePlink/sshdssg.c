     * Set up the phase limits for the progress report. We do this
     * by passing minus the phase number.
     *
     * For prime generation: our initial filter finds things
     * coprime to everything below 2^16. Computing the product of
     * (p-1)/p for all prime p below 2^16 gives about 20.33; so
     * among B-bit integers, one in every 20.33 will get through
     * the initial filter to be a candidate prime.
     *
     * Meanwhile, we are searching for primes in the region of 2^B;
     * since pi(x) ~ x/log(x), when x is in the region of 2^B, the
     * prime density will be d/dx pi(x) ~ 1/log(B), i.e. about
     * 1/0.6931B. So the chance of any given candidate being prime
     * is 20.33/0.6931B, which is roughly 29.34 divided by B.
     *
     * So now we have this probability P, we're looking at an
     * exponential distribution with parameter P: we will manage in
     * one attempt with probability P, in two with probability
     * P(1-P), in three with probability P(1-P)^2, etc. The
     * probability that we have still not managed to find a prime
     * after N attempts is (1-P)^N.
     * 
     * We therefore inform the progress indicator of the number B
     * (29.34/B), so that it knows how much to increment by each
     * time. We do this in 16-bit fixed point, so 29.34 becomes
     * 0x1D.57C4.
