= Release 1.8.14.0 =
Released: Unreleased

== Features ==
 * Fixed issue #2441: A way to disable the sound that is played on errors
 * Updated shipped TortoiseGitPlink and putty binaries to version 0.64
   If you are still using TortoisePLink, please switch to TortoiseGitPlink.

== Bug Fixes ==

 * Fixed issue #2432: MessageBox buttons cannot be localized
 * Fixed issue #2433: Cannot see the log in Diff with previous version
 * TortoiseGitBlame: Implemented search forward (F3) and search backward (Shift+F3)

= Release 1.8.13.0 =
Released: 2015-02-15

== Features ==
 * Improved auto update
   Version checks will use SSL (on Vista or newer systems)
   New version.txt file format with more options
 * Fixed issue #2243: Submodule red-icon doesn't propagate to higher folders (configurable now)

   You might need to kill TGitCache.exe once using the TaskManager in order to reset its cache

 * Fixed issue #1400: Allow the use of tags within the Git Rebase dialog
 * Fixes issue #2417: Resolving a conflict forces refresh of Commit Dialog
   A new advanced option (RefreshFileListAfterResolvingConflict) was added which controls
   whether file lists are refreshed after resolving conflicts. By default this is set to
   true, but can be disabled in cases where refreshing the list takes lots of time or
   people don't want the list to automatically scroll to the top (this also mitigates
   issue #1949 until we have a cleaner fix). F5 for manual refresh is needed if enabled.
 * Fixed issue #56: Ability to use Cygwin's git instead of msysGit
   Check out the manual (keyword "Cygwin git") regarding Cygwin Git support and configuration hints.
   Please note that Cygwin Git is not officially supported by TortoiseGit as the developers only
   use Git for Windows. Bugreports, however, are welcome.

 * Fixed issue #2362: git.exe get stuck on Win XP

 * Updated libgit2 in order to fix CVE-2014-9390.
   TortoiseGit is not affected in its default configuration (libgit2 has to be manually enabled for cloning).
   Git for Windows and mSysGit < 1.9.5 are affected, so an update highly recommended.

 * TGitCache now does not check the contents of files with filesize > 10 MiB any more
   and falls back to checking the timestamp of the files (as if TGitCacheCheckContent
   is set to "false") according the the git index. This limit can be changed by adjusting
   TGitCacheCheckContentMaxSize (measured in KiB) in TortoiseGit advanced settings.
   The reason for this change is that libgit2 reads a file to memory for hashing and,
   thus, locking the file and the repository for this time span.
