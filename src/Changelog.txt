= Release 2.15.0.1 =
Released: 2024-04-15

PuTTY 0.81 fixes a critical vulnerability CVE-2024-31497 in the use of 521-bit ECDSA keys (ecdsa-sha2-nistp521). If you have used a 521-bit ECDSA private key with any previous version of PuTTY, consider the private key compromised: remove the public key from authorized_keys files, and generate a new key pair.

However, this only affects that one algorithm and key size. No other size of ECDSA key is affected, and no other key type is affected.
