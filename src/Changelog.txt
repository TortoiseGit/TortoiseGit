       reduce the amount of lines/bars drawn. (Stefan)
- CHG: The date filter in the log dialog now prevents the user from selecting
       dates outside the shown log messages. (Michael Dietschi)

       couldn't be expanded to show all subfolders but needed an F5
       to actually get refreshed. (Stefan)
- BUG: When ignoring all whitespaces is turned on in TortoiseMerge,
       the merge result contained the lines of the base file
       instead of "mine". (Stefan)

       first line in a file was modified. (Stefan)
- BUG: When resolving with "mine before theirs" or "theirs before mine",
       the line numbering was wrong. See issue #197. (Stefan)

       checkout dialog. A link starting with "svn:" will start the
       repository browser. (Stefan)
- NEW: TortoiseMerge can ignore case-only changes when diffing. (Stefan)
- NEW: Autocompletion for language-dependent keywords (usually class/method/
       variable names) in the commit dialog. (Stefan)
- NEW: Bugtracking integration extended with regular expressions. (Stefan)
- NEW: The autocompletion feature can be deactivated in the settings. (Stefan)
- NEW: Paths are checked if they're valid on Windows and an error/warning
       is shown if they're not to avoid problems later. (Stefan)

       replaced with the history text. (Stefan)

       indicates that. (Stefan)

       anyway. (Stefan)

       updates to folders anymore. This makes it look more consistent with the

       browser, it was treated as a folder. (Stefan)
- BUG: Right-drag export of more than one folder made the

       menu, the separator was still added. (Stefan)

       the same, and with that patch we save 800KB for the additional
       iconv library. (Stefan)
- DEV: Patched apr-iconv to first check in the modules path for the

- CHG: Many cosmetic changes to the UI. (Stefan)

       once. (Stefan)

       i.e. the logmessage is wrapped at the right
       end of the dialog box. (Stefan)

       copy did not include the changes from the
       working copy! (Stefan)
- BUG: In the Commit and the Add dialog: if a file was
       selected then only the topmost parentfolder was
       automatically selected instead of all intermediant
       parentfolders. (Stefan)
- BUG: Export always used HEAD, even if another revision
       was specified in the dialog. (Stefan)
- BUG: Showing diffs for changed files from the list in
       the log dialog was done with the wrong revisions. (Stefan)
- BUG: When adding files in a directory with svn:externals
       in it already controlled files got shown in
       the add dialog. (Stefan)
- BUG: Some patchfiles were not parsed correctly. (Stefan)
- BUG: Fixed a massive memory leak when showing logs,
       also reduced memory consumption when 
       committing. (Stefan)

       the explorer columns weren't sorted by name. (Stefan)

       default application in the commit dialog. (Stefan)
- NEW: By placing a '#' in front of the paths for the
       external diff/merge programs make TSVN use
       it's own program TortoiseMerge. This helps
       users who want to switch easily between

       while the status of the working copy files
       is checked. (Stefan)

       some garbage characters instead of clean
       Unicode chars. (Stefan)

       dialog. (Stefan)
- BUG: Menu settings could be ignored if 
       the first settings change is to put
       all menu entries in the submenu. If
       any other setting was made first then
       everything was ok. (Stefan)
- BUG: When creating a folder on the repository
       root in the browser the refresh function
       went too far up. (Stefan)
- BUG: If no log entry was selected a right-click
       or a left-click on the message area below

Version 0.21
- NEW: If multiple targets are selected for
       update the all targets which belong to
       the same repository (have the same uuid)
       are updated to the same revision, no matter
       if another commit happened in between
       those updates. (Stefan)
- NEW: Subversion got a new command: "Blame".
       TSVN has it too :) What it does?
       It shows you for each line in a file
       the revision it was last changed and
       the author (so you can blame a bug
       on that author :). (Stefan)
- NEW: The show log command now only shows
       the last 100 revisions, configurable

       browser weren't shown (refresh did
       not work). (Stefan)
- BUG: "An invalid argument was encountered"
       in the log-dialog when working only
       with keyboard got fixed. (Stefan)

       and trying to show the subversion
       properties could crash the explorer.

       browser. Also a new command in the context
       menu to start the repo browser. (Stefan)

       operation you can now just doubleclick on
       the conflicted entry to start the external
       merge program. (Stefan)

       This lead to wrong icon overlays and needed
       several "F5" to get the right ones. (Stefan)
- CHG: The "rename" command now uses the --force option
       by default so that modified files can be renamed
       too. (Stefan)

       than before). (Stefan)
- NEW: The property page is now shown for multiple
       files too (without the information about
       a file, since every file has different

       to set/remove properties on multiple files
       at once. (Stefan)

Version 0.18
- BUG: The repository browser didn't escape the url
       sequences. (Stefan)

- NEW: A new entry in the main settings page can be
       used to tell TSVN to reuse the entered log-message
       in the commit dialog even if the user cancels
       the dialog. This was a user request. (Stefan)
- NEW: New right-drag command to copy files/folders
       inside a working copy. (Stefan)
- NEW: Ask the user for external programs if none
       is specified in the settings. Also if no WinDiff
       like program is found do a unified diff and show
       that in a text-editor. (Stefan)
- NEW: The context menu layout is configurable from
       the settings dialog. (Stefan)

       was always active, even for URL's which 
       can't be opened. (Stefan)
- BUG: Two more dialogs (Updates and Commit) were
       missing the new subversion statuses. (Stefan)

       or all deselected then an error message
       was shown. (Stefan)
- BUG: In the log dialog if more than 500 files were
       changed in a revision then it showed "and 0 more"
       instead of the real remaining files. (Stefan)
- CHG: Changed the behaviour of the Log and Updates
       dialog if a network timeout occurred. (Stefan)
- CHG: If the option "recursive overlays" is not set
       then the status for folders is always set to
       "normal" to speed things up a little. (Stefan)
- CHG: Added a timeout to the status cache. This
       is a workaround so that refreshing (pressing
       F5) isn't needed that much. (Stefan)
- CHG: Improved the status caching. (Stefan)
- CHG: if only the properties were modified then
       this is indicated by a "(P only)" in
       the status text in the commit dialog. (Stefan)

       issues 38 and 60. (Stefan)

       a progress dialog is shown. (Stefan)

- CHG: Some icons are changed, some new. (Lübbe)
- CHG: If a file is deleted from the filesystem but not
       removed from version control the icon overlay
       shows the "deleted" icon. (Stefan)
- NEW: In the log dialog a new context menu entry
       for creating a tag from a specific revision.
       This solves issue 53. (Stefan)
- NEW: In the log dialog there's a context menu
       in the list of changed files to show the
       changes you made to that file in that
       revision. Solves issue 55. (Stefan)
- NEW: Added another context menu entry to the
       log dialog for creating a unified diff
       file (patch file) and showing that
       inside an external viewer. (Stefan)
- NEW: revert changes of a specific revision in
       the log dialog. (Stefan)
- NEW: New command to check for updates on the
       server. (Stefan)

Version 0.12.1
- BUG: If an error occurred while executing a command
       in the log dialog the ok button wasn't reenabled
       again. (Stefan)
- BUG: Some with the file:/// prefix paths could crash 
       the repository browser. (Stefan)
- BUG: Fixed typo in the conflict editor hint box. (Stefan)
- CHG: Changed some german translations. (Stefan)
- CHG: The Language Combo in the settings page is
       increased in size for all languages. (Stefan)
- CHG: reorganized the submenu. (Stefan)
- CHG: The installer doesn't contain the debug symbols
       and the crashhandler anymore. They can be downloaded
       separately. (Stefan)
- NEW: The About dialog shows which version of TSVN is
       installed (UNICODE or MBCS) in the window title. (Stefan)
- NEW: A new command which starts the default browser
       with the daily use guide. (Stefan)
              
Version 0.12
- BUG: hopefully fixed the bug in the repository-
       browser when using paths with four/five
       slashes. (Stefan)
- BUG: fixed some bugs in the repository browser. (Stefan)
- BUG: deselecting a file inside a folder in the
       add dialog lead to deactivation of _all_
       files which started with the same path, even
       if they weren't in the same folder. (Stefan)
- BUG: menu entries were shown twice for "link" files
       like .lnk and .rdp. This solves issue 52. (Stefan)
- BUG: the merge function wasn't working correctly since
       no revisions were used. (Stefan)
- CHG: the log command now has the strict-option
       set to false instead of true. (Stefan)
- CHG: time/date is now shown using the local
       format. This solves issue 49. (Stefan)
- CHG: removed dependency to msimg32.dll. (Stefan)
- CHG: the commit dialog shows the modified files
       with path. (Stefan)
- CHG: the rename dialog allows only to rename and
       not to move anymore. To move files do a right
       drag in explorer. (Stefan)
- CHG: in the show-log dialog only the first 50
       files that were changed are listed to reduce
       memory consumption. (Stefan)
- NEW: repository browser works with svn://
       svn+ssl:// (Stefan)
- NEW: enhanced the repository browser with a
       popup-menu containing commands like
       "show log", "save as..." and "open". (Stefan)
- NEW: new menu entry to start an external merge
       program, including parameters. (Stefan)
- NEW: the "temporary file mask" can now contain
       folders (marked with a backslash at the end)
       and has a positive list (marked with a 
       plus sign "+" in front). So you are now
       able to specify something like
       "+readme.txt;*.txt;cvs\" which will allow
       the file readme.txt but deny all other *.txt
       files, and will deny all folders and files within
       a folder named "cvs". 
       Please note that the order is from left
       to right - so "*.txt;+readme.txt" will deny
       all *.txt files, the readme.txt will also
       be denied since it has lower priority than
       the *.txt match. (Stefan)
- NEW: before doing a merge TSVN checks if the
       working copy has uncommitted changes
       and shows an error message if it has. (Stefan)
- NEW: if a file has been deleted in the explorer but
       not in version control then the commit dialog
       lets the user select those files and they
       will be deleted from version control before
       the commit. (Stefan)
- NEW: better caching of subversion statuses. (Stefan)
- NEW: two new icon overlays for status "deleted"
       and for status "added". (Stefan)
- NEW: new command "relocate". (Stefan)

Version 0.11.2
- BUG: entering the settings page without
       activating the icon overlay page
       resulted in complete loss of 
       overlay settings if other changes
       were saved. (Stefan)
- BUG: in our own caching provider the
       username/password wasn't initialized
       on the first attempt - this lead to
       undetermined behaviour and crashes!
       (Stefan)
- CHG: some minor GUI changes in the property
       page for the explorer, according to
       the hint from Dimentiy. (Stefan)
- CHG: the url in the property page is no
       longer compacted. (Stefan)

Version 0.11.0
- BUG: if all files were deselected in the commit
       dialog then the progress dialog couldn't be
       closed anymore. (Stefan)
- BUG: Resizing of dialogs didn't work correctly
       so I changed the resizing system (Stefan)
- BUG: corrected tooltip in the checkout dialog (Stefan)
- BUG: for network paths TSVN created a file:// path
       with five instead of four slashes. (Stefan)
- CHG: Repository browser now has a minimal size
       so that resizing works better. (Stefan)
- CHG: if the checkout directory is left empty
       then the OK button is now disabled (Stefan)
- CHG: if no valid path is given then the
       repository browser opens now on the
       desktop by default. (Stefan)
- CHG: unified interface elements. Issue 45. (Stefan)
- CHG: made the menu entries align with others. (Stefan)
- CHG: the menu icons are still ownerdrawn, but
       if the registry entry 
       (DWORD)HKCU\Software\TortoiseSVN\OwnerdrawnMenus
       is set to 0 (zero) then TortoiseSVN uses
       the system to draw the icons. (Stefan)       
- NEW: Translation to russian language added (Dimentiy).
- NEW: in the property page it's now possible to
       select and copy/paste the information. This
       fixes issue 46. (Stefan)
- NEW: After creating a repository now a messagebox
       appears to inform the user of the finished
       command. (Stefan)
- NEW: new menu entry in the log dialog: it's now
       possible to "update to revision" with a
       right click on a specific revision log
       entry. Issue 44. (Stefan)
- NEW: the about box now contains the version
       of subversion TortoiseSVN is linked
       against. Issue 43. (Stefan)
- NEW: TSVN now has it's own caching provider.
       That means that username/password are
       cached during an active session, i.e.
       as long as a dialog is open. This prevents
       the user from entering username/password
       multiple times in the repository browser. (Stefan)
- NEW: the repository browser now always shows
       the full path so the user can select
       elements "above" the one initially entered.
       This fixes issue 47 (but not with an "up"
       button). (Stefan)
       
Version 0.10.0
- BUG: if several files are selected for committing
       and the first one is unversioned or just
       added a crash occurred (Stefan)
- BUG: if a folder was renamed in a working copy
       with a system rename (not a 'svn rename')
       then explorer crashed. Issue 39. (Stefan)
- BUG: if an error occurred while reading the
       config file it wasn't reported. (Stefan)
- BUG: the settings page crashed if not all pages
       were selected before hitting "ok". (Stefan)
- BUG: copy/paste and drag'n'drop of unversioned
       files could crash explorer. (Stefan)
- BUG: import with "use foldername as modulename"
       didn't work, the modulename was some random
       characters. (Stefan)
- BUG: The check for temporary files when doing an
       import wasn't able to delete those. (Stefan)
- BUG: The disk drive now shouldn't be scanned
       anymore if (in the settings) the icon
       overlays for removable drives is turned off.
       (Stefan)
- BUG: Pathnames weren't correctly converted for
       checkouts. (Stefan)
- NEW: in the settings page there's now an option
       if the user wants to have unversioned files
       shown before a commit so (s)he can add it
       before the commit. (Stefan)
- NEW: the add dialog now shows the files with
       the relative path so the user can better
       check if a file needs to be added or not.
       This is especially useful if folders
       are added. (Stefan)
- NEW: Two new column providers: one for the URL
       of subversion files/folders and the other
       for a shortened URL without the server
       and file part. (Stefan)
- NEW: new icons (Luebbe)
- CHG: before obtaining a subversion status we
       now first check if an .svn directory
       exists - this should speed up things
       a little. (Stefan)
- CHG: In the commit dialog the focus is now
       set to the edit control where the user
       enters the log message. (Stefan)
- CHG: adjusted the messagebox colors to system
       colors. (Stefan)
- CHG: The green color in the progress dialog
       got replaced with the system color for
       selection background. The red color is
       still hardcoded - I think users who set
       the dialog background to red are crazy
       anyway :) (Stefan)
- CHG: exchanged positions of the ok and 
       cancel button on popular request (Stefan).

Version 0.9.2
- BUG: In the Add dialog unversioned folders
       with items in it lead to a crash (Stefan)
- BUG: removed the unused "Help" button from the 
       settings page (Stefan)
- BUG: The coloring in the progress dialog was wrong 
       if the wc contained svn:externals (Stefan)
- BUG: TortoiseSVN wasn't working on Win98-based
       systems anymore 'cause we now use UNICODE.
       So changed the code to compile for either
       MBCS _or_ UNICODE. This means we have
       to provide two binary versions of TSVN 
       from now on (Stefan)
- CHG: The menu items now are properly aligned
       for both with and without icons (Stefan)
- CHG: merge/tag uses again an url->url copy
       command instead of a wc->url copy since
       this doesn't work for working copy root
       folders. (Stefan)

Version 0.9.1
- BUG: the zlib dll lead to some crashes, so
       I went back to statically linked zlib (Stefan)
- BUG: The prompt dialog for log messages wasn't
       resized properly. (Stefan)
- BUG: The check for temp files was case aware (Stefan)
       
Version 0.9 (Subversion 0.21, rev 5631)
- BUG: in some dialog the repository browser button
       was disabled (Stefan)

- BUG: files matching the temporary extensions were
       not added even if the user explicitly selected
       them for adding. (Stefan)
- BUG: The folder icon overlay disappeared if the
       svn:ignored property was set and an ignored
       file was in the folder (Stefan)
- NEW: in the commit dialog (logprompt) there's now
       a label showing to where the commit goes so
       the user can see if (s)he committing to
       a branch or trunk (or worse: to a tag) (Stefan)
- NEW: in the "show log" dialog its now possible to
       select two revisions and the context menu then
       allows to compare those two revisions (Stefan)
- NEW: browse button for merge dialog (Stefan)
- NEW: log messages now have a list of the changed/added
       removed and moved files added (Stefan)

       prompt if (s)he wants to save it or not (Stefan)
- NEW: if import or commit get interrupted 'cause of
       an error the log message is preserved (Stefan)
- NEW: a doubleclick on the file list in the commit
       dialog starts the external diff program so you
       can see the changes you made to the files
       before committing (Stefan)
- NEW: The temporary file mask now can have wildcards
       like ? and * too. (Stefan)
- NEW: Icon overlays can now be disabled for different
       drive types (Stefan)
- CHG: the ok button is disabled in the show log dialog
       while popup-commands are executed (Stefan)
- CHG: when committing, only files in versioned dirs are
       shown to the user for adding before the commit
       occurs (Stefan)
- CHG: order in which the files are passed to the diff
       program (Stefan)
- CHG: the icon overlay should now be faster. This 
       affects mostly big directories but smaller ones
       should profit from it too. (Stefan)
- CHG: converted both projects (shell and main part)
       to UNICODE. This to support non-ANSI characters
       both for viewing and entering. This also solves
       Issue 37. (Stefan)
- CHG: the temp file mask is now stored under HKCU
       instead of HKLM (Stefan)

Version 0.8.1
- BUG: the add menu was missing for single files (Stefan)

       (Stefan)
- BUG: if the user selected unversioned items for updating
       then TSVN could crash (Stefan)
- BUG: in the copy dialog the error message from subversion
       was not shown (only the beep was heard). (Stefan)
- BUG: if the user pressed "Cancel" in the authentication
       dialog then still another retry was made (Stefan)
- BUG: if the URL in the combobox was deleted then the
       repository browser button was disabled forever. (Stefan)
- BUG: if the repository browser was used a second time then
       the icons of the items were gone. (Stefan)
- BUG: the history combo now works as expected (Stefan)
- CHG: in the switch dialog now the 'switch to branch'
       checkbox is removed since the 'update to revision'
       command does exactly this. (Stefan)
- CHG: the copy command now uses the progess dialog (Stefan)
- CHG: use always wc->url in copy command (Stefan)
- NEW: the progress dialog now shows the different actions

       branch/tag is made. (Stefan)

Version 0.8
- CHG: most used commands are now in the top context menu and
       not in the submenu anymore (Stefan)
- CHG: Modified the SVN Progress dialog so that the columns are
       resized before any data is added. Also ensured that all
       items are *entirely* visible even if the horizontal scroll
       bar is visible. (Damian)

       contain the current working directory (InitInstanceMade
       method of the CTortoiseProcApp class). (Damian)
- NEW: If the user selects two files then there's now a "Diff"
       entry in the submenu which starts the external diff program
       on those two files. It's not required that the two files
       be under version control - it works on every two files.
       This is a handy and fast way to see the diff. (Stefan)
- NEW: delete and rename command has now an own menu icon (Stefan)
- BUG: the "save as..." dialog didn't show up under NT4 'cause
       of the changed size of OPENFILENAME structure (Stefan)

- NEW: in the import dialog it's now possible to specify if
       the foldername should be used as the new module name
       or (if not checked) if the contents of the folder 
       should be imported directly to the url. (Stefan)
- NEW: if the user selects a directory for "Add" then
       a dialog shows up showing all unversioned items

- BUG: the width and height of the context menu is now calculated
       correctly according to the length of the string and the
       selected system font. (Stefan)
- BUG: columnprovider crashed for unversioned files inside a working
       copy. (Stefan)
- BUG: committing of several selected files resulted in several
       separate commits instead of only one. (Stefan)
- BUG: the modulename in checkout was ignored. (Stefan)
- ENH: resizable dialogs now have a resize grip on the bottom right
       corner to show the user that they are resizable. (Stefan)
- NEW: a diff command exists now in the context menu for comparing
       the changes to the text-base (changes since last commit).
       (Stefan)
- NEW: when doing a commit TSVN now determines first which files
       need a commit and let the user select which of these
       are actually needed for a commit. This makes it also easier
       to write log messages since its visible which files have
       changed. (Stefan)
       
Version 0.5
- BUG: two separators could appear together in submenu (Tim)
- BUG: changed the projects to using the berkeley db
       built with VC.NET instead of VC6.

       dialog (Tim)

       (Stefan)
- NEW: two new column providers: one for the revision number and
       the second overrides the predefined "author" column. (Stefan)
- NEW: added browse button to the Import dialog. You can now browse 
       the local filesystem for a local repository. You can also 
       browse a repository (local and remote) for paths. (Tim)

Version 0.4
- BUG: errors were not displayed to the user for commit and add 
       (Stefan)
- BUG: in the log dialog the wrong log entries were shown when
       the selection was changed with the up/down key (Stefan)
- BUG: fixed HKLM and HKCU discrepancies in the registry settings
       (Stefan)
