/**
 * Sets the Task ID (Win7) for the process according to settings
 * in the registry:
 * HKCU\\Software\\TortoiseGit\\GroupTaskbarIconsPerRepo
 * determines how this is done. The Task ID is used by the windows
 * taskbar to determine how the app icons on the taskbar are grouped
 * together.
 *
 * GroupTaskbarIconsPerRepo = 0 : Icons are grouped by application.
 * GroupTaskbarIconsPerRepo = 1 : same as 0, one icon per application (regardless of working tree)
 * GroupTaskbarIconsPerRepo = 2 : All TGit icons are grouped to one icon (regardless of working tree)
 * GroupTaskbarIconsPerRepo = 3 : Icons are grouped by working tree path, so
 *                                each TGit dialog gets grouped according
 *                                to the working tree it is used for.
 *                                Each TGit app is grouped separately, i.e.,
 *                                TortoiseGitMerge icons won't get grouped together
 *                                with TortoiseGitProc icons.
 * GroupTaskbarIconsPerRepo = 4 : The same as 1, but all TGit apps are treated
 *                                as one, e.g., a TortoiseGitMerge instance showing
 *                                a diff from repo X is grouped together with
 *                                a log dialog instance for repo X.
 *
 * The repository uuid is used by examining the command line of the process:
 * it must be set with /groupuuid:"uuid".

 * To receive this message, you must first register it:
