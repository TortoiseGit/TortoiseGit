#	typemap.dat
#
#	Use this file to define namespace prefix and type bindings for
#	the generated header files by the 'wsdl2h' tool.  typemap.dat is the
#	default file processed by 'wsdl2h' to customize its output. You can use
#	wsdl2h option -t to specify an alternate file.
#
#	XML namespace prefix bindings can be provided to override the default
#	choice of the ns1, ns2, ... prefixes generated by wsdl2h.  It is highly
#	recommended to provide namespace prefixes for your project's XML
#	namespaces. In this way, changes to the WSDL (or newer releases of
#	wsdl2h) will have a minimal impact on coding.
#	Bindings for namespace prefixes are of the form:
#		prefix = "URI"
#
#	Type bindings can by provided to bind XML schema types to C/C++ types
#	for your project.
#	Type bindings are of the form:
#		prefix__type = declaration | use | ptr-use
#	where 'declaration' introduces the type in the header file, 'use'
#	specifies how the type is used directly, 'ptr-use' specifies how the
#	type is used as a pointer type.
#	For example:
#		xsd__string = | char* | char*
#	After enabling this line, all XSD strings will be mapped to char*. Note
#	that the 'declaration' part is empty in this case.
#
#	Member data and functions can be provided to extend a generated struct
#	or class.
#	Class and struct extensions are of the form:
#		prefix__type = $ member-declaration
#	For example, to add a constructor and destructor to class myns__record:
#		myns__record = $ myns__record();
#		myns__record = $ ~myns__record();
#	
#	Any other material to be included in the generated header file can be
#	provided by enclosing the text within brackets [ and ]. Brackets MUST
#	appear at the start of a new line.
#	For example, to include a note:
#[
#// TODO: Don't forget to bind the namespace prefixes!
#]
#	This comment appears as the first line in the generated header file.
