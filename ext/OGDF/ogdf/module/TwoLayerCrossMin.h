 * \brief Interface of two-layer crossing minimization algorithms.
 *
 * The interface of a two-layer crossing minimization algorithm consists of
 * three methods:
 *   -# init(const Hierarchy & H) must be called first. This initializes the module
 *      for operating on hierarchy \a H.
 *   -# call(Level &L) (or operator()(Level &L)) performs two-layer crossing minimization,
 *      where \a L is the permutable level and the neighbor level of \a L (fixed
 *      level) is determined by the hierarchy (see documentation of class Hierarchy).
 *      Any number of call's may be performed once init() has been executed.
 *   -# cleanup() has to be called last and performs some final clean-up work.
