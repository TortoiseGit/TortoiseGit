//! Module for planarity testing and planar embeddings.
/**
 * This is a module defining functions to test planarity of graphs, and to embed planar graphs (i.e., find
 * a rotation scheme of the edges around their incident vertices defining a plane graph).
 *
 * Use this module only if you want to be able to (later on) decide which planarity test to use.
 * If you simply want to test planarity or to embed a graph, use the simpler/preferred method:
 * the direct function calls in extended_graph_alg.h (ogdf::isPlanar, ogdf::planarEmbed,
 * ogdf::planarEmbedPlanarGraph), which use the most efficient BoyerMyrvold algorithm.
