/** \file
 * \brief implementation of initial cut-constraint class for the Branch&Cut algorithm
 * for the Maximum C-Planar SubGraph problem.
 *
 * A feasible ILP solution has to imply a completely connected, planar Sub-Clustergraph.
 * For each cluster that is not connected, additional connection edges have to be inserted
 * between the chunks of the cluster, to obtain c-connectivity.
 * Thus, initial constraints are added that guarantee initial c-connectivity, if the number of chunks
 * is at most 3. If some cluster consists of more than 3 chunks, additional constraints
 * have to be separated during the optimization.
