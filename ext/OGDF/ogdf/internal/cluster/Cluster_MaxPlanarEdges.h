 * \brief Declaration of a constraint class for the Branch&Cut algorithm
 * for the Maximum C-Planar SubGraph problem.
 *
 * These constraint do not necessarily belong to the ILP formulation, but
 * have the purpose to strengthen the LP-relaxations in the case of very dense
 * Graphs, by restricting the maximum number of edges that can occur in any optimal
 * solution according to Euler's formula for planar Graphs: |E| <= 3|V|-6
