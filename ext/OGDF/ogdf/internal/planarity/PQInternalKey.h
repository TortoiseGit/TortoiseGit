 * The class template PQInternalKey is a derived class of class template
 * PQBasicKey. PQInternalKey is a concrete class.
 * It is constructed to store any kind of information of internal nodes of the
 * PQ-tree. It may only be used for internal nodes as P- and
 * Q-nodes. This information is not allowed to leaves.
 *
 * The information is stored in \a m_userStructInternal and
 * is assigned to a unique node in the PQ-tree. This
 * unique node can be identified with the \a m_nodePointer of the
 * astract base class PQBasicKey. The
 * maintainance of this pointer is left to the user. By keeping the
 * responsibillity by the user, nodes with certain informations can
 * be identified and  accessed by him in constant time. This makes
 * the adaption of algorithms fast and easy.
