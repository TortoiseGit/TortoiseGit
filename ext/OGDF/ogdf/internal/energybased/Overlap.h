 * \brief Declaration of class Overlap which implements an energy
 *        function that gives a penalty for each pair of overlapping
 *        vertices.
 *
 * The penalty for each pair is the area of the overlap. It only
 * works if the shape of the vertices is a rectangle. It uses the
 * class IntersectionRectangle.
