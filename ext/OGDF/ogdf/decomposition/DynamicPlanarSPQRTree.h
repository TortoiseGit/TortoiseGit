/**
 * The class DynamicPlanarSPQRTree maintains the triconnected components of a
 * planar biconnected graph G and represents all possible embeddings
 * of G. Each skeleton graph is embedded.
 *
 * The current embeddings of the skeletons define an embedding of G.
 * There are two basic operations for obtaining another embedding
 * of G: reverse(v), which flips the skeleton of an R-node v
 * around its poles, and swap(v,e_1,e_2), which exchanges the
 * positions of the edges e_1 and e_2 in the skeleton of a P-node v.
