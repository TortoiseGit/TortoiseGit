/**
 * The class DynamicSkeleton maintains the skeleton \a S of a node \a vT in a dynamic SPQR-tree
 * \a T. We call \a T the owner tree of \a S and \a vT the corresponding tree node. Let
 * \a G be the original graph of \a T.
 *
 * \a S consists of an undirected multi-graph \a M. If the owner tree of \a S is
 * a PlanarSPQRTree, then \a M represents a combinatorial embedding.
 * The vertices in \a M correspond to vertices in \a G. The edges in \a M are of
 * two types: Real edges correspond to edges in \a G and virtual edges correspond
 * to tree-edges in \a T having \a vT as an endpoint.
 *
 * Let \a e in \a M be a virtual edge and \a eT be the corresponding tree-edge.
 * Then there exists exactly one edge \a e' in another skeleton \a S' of \a T that
 * corresponds to \a eT as well. We call \a e' the twin edge of \a e.
